And we always will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure a lack of bias in our assessment, we are currently completing a full audit of the Voyage compliance program, conducted independently by third-party legal counsel. We’ll publish the results here when we have them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SMS compliance and deliverability protocols are constantly evolving.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, we have already witnessed the impact of the deprecation of shared short codes and the introduction of 10DLC on an SMS marketing platform’s ability to adapt and evolve quickly. <strong>We have dedicated resources consistently canvassing the regulatory landscape,</strong> and we always embed relevant updates into our service and product accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage&#8217;s goal is to protect brands to the fullest extent possible when it comes to their SMS marketing and commerce program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder, <strong>Voyage clients have access to the following compliance-related features:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Robust reporting capabilities, to ensure they know when and by which method every subscriber has opted-in to an SMS program.</li><li>Manual unsubscribe of any customer, as requested in the Settings panel.</li><li>Double opt-in activation for certain list building methods that require it, including keyed-in entry and keyword list building campaigns</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, we’ve received a few client requests to implement a &#8220;fuzzy opt-out&#8221; feature. This is <strong>not </strong>a hard requirement governed by the TCPA, CTIA, etc. However, as we always take product feedback seriously, <strong>we are working on shipping a best-in-class Voyage version of fuzzy opt-out</strong> before the end of the month – that will be more accurate than those of other SMS platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge with any sort of fuzzy logic is to not inadvertently unsubscribe someone who does not have that intention. We have direct evidence there are issues with this feature in other SMS platforms, including (ironically) the competitor making claims against us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1206\" srcset=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example.png 550w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example-300x282.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /><figcaption>An example of an inadvertent opt-out due to imprecise fuzzy logic. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage Fuzzy Opt-out will be smarter about ensuring that subscribers who are opted-in do not inadvertently unsubscribe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a customer texts: &#8220;I would like to stop my order. Can you help me?,&#8221; this would not inaccurately unsubscribe the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, it would generate a prompt to open a CS ticket and/or show up in our Live Conversions panel for response. In fact, carriers have explicitly stated that automatic opt-out within a use case such as this is “invalid.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-1024x558.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1207\" srcset=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-1024x558.png 1024w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-300x164.png 300w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-768x419.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption><em>Voyage keyword and opt-out trigger logic tree.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we have also anecdotally heard that this same aforementioned <strong>competitor is claiming that multi-message drips are non-compliant</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also false.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality is that Voyage employs a more robust technology than our competitors, that enables multi-message drip automations that drive higher conversions and unlocks additional revenue from high-intent customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only written guidance that exists in this regard references best practices, provided at present by T-Mobile only. The T-Mobile code of conduct suggests that one alert should be sent per abandoned cart within 48 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To clarify, <strong>this is <em>not</em> a requirement by official governing bodies such as the TCPA and CTIA</strong>. We have confirmed this with two of the largest SMS message aggregators, who have decades of relationship experience with carriers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, at time of writing, <strong>sending a multi-message cart abandonment series will <em>not</em> result in a fine</strong> and is unlikely to result in any sort of broad message filtering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, we are adding the ability to segment by a recipient&#8217;s carrier in our segmentation builder. If desired, brands can add a T-Mobile filter to their cart abandonment drip automation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as always, brands can modify (and/or request that our service team modify) their cart abandonment automation series on the UI, to be single or multi-message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are confident that Voyage offers the most robust SMS marketing and message commerce solution in the market. Our platform will only continue to get more powerful over time, as we continue to partner with leading eCommerce brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder of <strong>what brands get with Voyage</strong>, that other platforms may not offer:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>More robust segmentation, including event and attribute metadata drill-down</li><li>Custom events on the UI, for use in drip automations and segmentation</li><li>Multi-message drip automations</li><li>Flexible, advanced reporting with Voyage Report Builder</li><li>Dynamic Click to Buy, for browse abandon, cart abandon and checkout abandon drip automations</li><li>Personalized variables from event data and subscriber attributes in list building, drip automations and marketing campaigns</li><li>Fully custom, hand-crafted, on-brand modals that drive quicker list growth than templated and semi-custom modals</li><li>Personalized conversational commerce at scale through Live Conversions, including as a Voyage managed service (in beta, available for wide release in early Q3)</li><li>And more&#8230;with more to come.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These features offer brands the flexibility and precision to drive maximal revenue, hyper-personalize messages at scale, and grow + engage their communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we continue to expand our team, including by growing our product and engineering functions, the Voyage platform will continue to evolve and advance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We are committed to offering clients the most cutting edge solutions that SMS marketing and message commerce has to offer.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rev Reddy</strong><br />CEO of Voyage SMS</p>\n<!--kg-card-end:

And <strong><em>message commerce</em></strong> is the right tool for exploring it – especially for brands with an eye on the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Emergence of Message Commerce: Filling a Gap</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first purchase on mobile occurred in 2008. Although the channel has obviously proved a potent driver of growth, brands face a few key challenges (even today) in pursuing scalable eCommerce success outside of desktop environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, to the lament of many marketers, most web sites are still not built with a mobile-first mindset. At the same time, and likely related to this, the explosive growth in browsing on mobile hasn&#8217;t kept pace with purchasing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until now, this has made mobile a lucrative channel for generating leads, but not necessarily for increasing conversions in like proportion. As a shopping experience, mobile can seem inferior to a consumer looking for more versatility, or speed, or just an easier purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But advancements in SMS eCommerce are closing this gap on mobile – fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SMS Evolution: From One-Way Blasts to Full Connectivity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Message commerce is in many ways already here, but the true potential of the channel has only begun to reveal itself to leading-edge marketers and engagement specialists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Voyage SMS, we help leading eCommerce brands meet their customers where they are, not only on their phones but in their texts messages, where open rates remain extraordinarily higher than email (as high as 98% to 15%).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see our clients succeeding with conversions everyday. As we&#8217;ve worked in tandem with them on their sales and engagement campaigns, it&#8217;s become clear that together we&#8217;re witnessing the evolution of SMS eCommerce into message commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the very near future, this will manifest as brands servicing their customers more fully on their terms, offering a flexible, individualized, full-cycle experience on SMS – that benefits everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Text-to-Buy sales flows</em></strong> will speed up checkouts and reduce abandoned carts.</li><li><strong><em>Digital wallets</em></strong>, attached to the much more reliable identifier of a phone number, will reduce complexity with conversions, delivering a more seamless experience for customers and fostering greater goodwill and loyalty for brands.</li><li><strong><em>Customers can text brands</em></strong> their questions, get them answered, and receive the sort of service a desktop interface can&#8217;t offer so easily and that web apps aren&#8217;t often focused on providing.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, message commerce is about catching sales pipelines up to consumer experience and expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Message Commerce Is About Quality and Efficiency</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a sample funnel:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A user sees an ad on Instagram</li><li>Swiping up on the ad opens an SMS message</li><li>User sends the message, your brand replies</li><li>The user replies &#8220;Buy,&#8221; and/or you answer their questions</li><li>Payment/Shipping details are captured and confirmed via app integration, or later, as part of their digital wallet</li><li>Receipt sent to customer, with a planned delay to allow for shipping and payment adjustments</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This keeps transactions simple, highly portable, and versatile among platforms and integrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, brands move from struggling to secure and identify leads on mobile for later desktop conversion –&nbsp;to guiding consumers from interest to purchase with less effort, right within their messages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Future Use Cases: Data-Driven Growth</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Already, we&#8217;re seeing early versions of this sort of buyer engagement pay dividends for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Utilizing SMS to close the gap between mobile browsing and desktop conversion ensures that brands&#8217; highest-engagement marketing channel is more closely aligned with their sales channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>For single SKU or low assortment brands</strong> that sell through direct channels, offer basic subscriptions, or want to upsell or maintain reorders, message commerce can lead to incredible growth.</li><li><strong>Retailers and restaurants</strong> will soon be able to offer contactless checkout via SMS. Customers can pay their bill by texting a number on their receipt.</li><li><strong>Non-profits and political organizations</strong> can collect donations more quickly, and at greater scale.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In all these cases, brands and organizations leveraging message commerce will continue to build data-driven customer lists and segments that can be immediately applied to further optimize and grow sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is only the beginning for message commerce</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Take Your Brand Into The Future with Message Commerce</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology required to secure this future is already here, and marketers and sellers looking to stay ahead would do well to keep pace with this exciting new frontier in eCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With our best-in-class SMS eCommerce platform and our dedicated experts blazing the trail, Voyage SMS will continue to lead the way towards message commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Interested in partnering with us now,</strong> on your SMS eCommerce needs?</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://www.voyagesms.com/get-started\">Request a

Brands","slug":"temp-slug-38","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<h3><strong>TL;DR: Most Can Still Utilize SMS with Proper Age Gating</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sex, Hate, Alcohol, Firearms, and Tobacco. And text messaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For so-called S.H.A.F.T. companies, keeping in compliance with SMS legislation and carrier rules can seem daunting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Referred to by many businesses as a new “wild west,” in 2021 there’s been a lot of talk (and some confusion) about what is and isn’t permitted for SMS eCommerce, if you operate a brand that might fall under one of these categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Voyage SMS, it’s our mission to help a diversity of clients best serve their customers, so let’s dig into the overall situation with SMS and S.H.A.F.T. brands, and clear up the confusion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, you can be sure to not only remain in compliance but also pursue your business goals through SMS – worry-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let’s move past one common misconception.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Rules Haven’t Changed – But Enforcement Has Shifted</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent chatter about SMS compliance updates are in actuality not about new legislative changes applying to S.H.A.F.T companies. Such rules have been in effect for a while, and have remained largely the same for some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What <em>has</em> changed is carrier enforcement. Carriers are simply paying more attention to whether S.H.A.F.T. brands are following federal rules under the FCC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This increased scrutiny has for related reasons coincided with the grandfathering out of shared short codes. With more brands texting, carriers want to more easily gather detailed information on who is and who is not complying with regulation. You can’t do that when brands are sharing short codes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the facts. The rumors circulating suggest a more dramatic – and incorrect – interpretation: that S.H.A.F.T. companies are being restricted from SMS marketing altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>That’s not the case – with one exception*</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Solution: Proper Age Gating</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage SMS was built to flexibly serve all marketers’ unique needs. Just as no consumer is the same, no brand is the same. This remains a primary driver of our product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, our custom-designed lead capture forms ensure immediate compliance for all S.H.A.F.T. brands. Consumers must provide a valid age to opt-in to our text messaging platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, look at how we’re executing proper age gating for Winc:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM-1024x536.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1228\" srcset=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM-1024x536.png 1024w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM-300x157.png 300w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM-768x402.png 768w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For any brand leaders that want to be doubly sure, you don’t have to just take our word for it.

Since SMS is native to ophones, texting is now the primary mode of communication. This makes SMS more effective for promotional campaigns and special discounts, as brands can ensure that their customers never miss a good deal or offer.</p><p>Brands can leverage this engagement to make sure that consumers get timely notifications for confirming their orders, acknowledging payment, and tracking their deliveries. SMS is also useful in helping brands <a href=\"http://blog.voyagetext.com/guides-to-sms-marketing/text-messaging-abandoned-cart/\">recover their abandoned carts more effectively</a>.</p><h2 id=\"the-solution\"><strong>The Solution</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/\">Voyage</a> helped an ecommerce client build a text marketing campaign as a part of a 4-day sale, generating $360k in revenue through SMS. This represented 30% of the total revenue generated from the brand’s website during the sale.

Lead generation is one of the most important elements of your inbound marketing strategy and plays a major role in converting visitors into leads and eventually into paying customers. If your business is small and relatively new, quality is always more important than quantity when it comes to <a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/product\">lead generation</a>.</p><p>But <em>how</em> do you generate more qualified leads? The simplest answer: through high-quality content. To be more specific, you need content that adds value to the customer and helps them in their buyer journey. You need the customer to be able to find you online easily, especially if your business is in the ecommerce domain. Here, inbound marketing contributes greatly to a business’s lead generation.</p><p>Some of the most prominent and effective methods of generating leads through inbound marketing include website SEO optimization, blogs, social media posts and engagements, landing pages, videos, etc. Outbound marketing tools like paid search, banner ads, social media ads, email marketing, SMS marketing etc. create a demand for your products or services, prompting them to engage with your brand online.</p><p>After choosing the right marketing channels to use, you must define your audience. For this, you need to create a buyer persona for your potential customers, typically based on parameters such as their age and gender, their income, and from where they were sourced as a lead. Then, identify which channels your audience engages with the most. This will help you create a more accurate buyer journey to send your message on the right channels at the right time.</p><h2 id=\"why-text-marketing-is-an-effective-lead-generation-tool\"><strong>Why text marketing is an effective lead generation tool</strong></h2><p>SMS marketing can be set up in almost no time - unlike email marketing, there is no design or development involved. Not only is it easier to create a message, but texts are also more likely to generate a response from recipients than emails. At least 90% of texts are opened, compared to just 20% of emails. That’s nearly five times the engagement of email and considerably more than any other channel.</p><p>The simplest and most reliable way of gaining consent from your leads is to use an SMS marketing platform. With the help of the platform, you can ask leads and prospects to provide consent by using a simple input to opt in to your text marketing list.</p><p>If your SMS marketing platform integrates with your CRM, you can track opt-ins and use system filters to make sure you never send messages to anyone who doesn’t want them.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-sms-marketing-for-lead-nurturing\"><strong>How to use SMS marketing for lead nurturing</strong></h2><h3 id=\"personalize\"><strong>Personalize</strong></h3><p>This is an important one. When we say personalization, we mean gathering information about leads and their interests, then marketing to them by showing them things that you know they will be interested in. Not everyone wants the same things, so sending blanket emails and displaying the same offers to everyone on your ecommerce site will leave you short of your goals. With a good <a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/\">SMS marketing solution</a>, you can gather information about leads’ likes, dislikes, interests and past buying behaviors (and more), and use this information to personalize your outreach.</p><p>If they have browsed for new shoes on your site, send them emails about a sale you’re having on shoes. If they’ve purchased t-shirts in the past, configure your marketing automation system to display pop-ups that offer them discounts on t-shirts. Marketing automation software makes this easy by allowing you to assign tags to leads based on their behavior and then segment them based on those tags.</p><h3 id=\"get-to-know-your-leads\"><strong>Get to know your leads</strong></h3><p>Marketing works with Sales to establish key criteria for lead segmentation and scoring. Hopefully, you have already created a comprehensive list of buyer personas and a detailed buyer journey for each. The next step is to plan how you will capture this information through landing pages and forms, using a progressive profiling approach so that conversion rates are kept high. Identify relevant pages and events that, if visited or triggered, also allow you to update lead profiles during the buyer journey. Access LinkedIn, Data.com, Hoovers and other business data sites you can use to cross-reference leads and further develop their profiles. Some of these sources can be directly integrated through HubSpot and Salesforce apps and APIs.</p><h3 id=\"lead-scoring\"><strong>Lead Scoring</strong></h3><p>Set up lead scoring criteria and point system to update lead lifecycle stages, move leads to the CRM at the right time, and trigger notifications using marketing automation workflows. Leads accumulate positive scores for behavior and demographics.</p><p><strong>Create a buyer persona</strong></p><p><strong><em>Based on:</em></strong></p><p><strong>Engagement</strong>: number of visits, unique page views, repeat visits, form conversions, email opens and clicks, blog comments, social media mentions, inbound links.</p><p><strong>Buyer stage</strong>: clicks and conversions on specific content indicating a lead lifecycle change, such as mid-funnel and bottom-funnel offers.</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>: recency of engagement, volume and timing of events indicating an imminent intent to buy. Also, apply negative scoring for form answers or behaviors that designate a lead as a poor fit, for example: competitor company, low budget or non-company email address.</p>","comment_id":"611de25d500330003e87aed4","feature_image":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/carlos-arthur-m-r-1147377-unsplash-1-768x512-1.jpeg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-08-19T04:47:25.000+00:00","updated_at":"2021-08-27T20:35:15.000+00:00","published_at":"2019-04-23T18:23:00.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"authors":[{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"}],"tags":[{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b1","name":"eCommerce Digital Marketing 101","slug":"ecommerce-digital-marketing-101","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/ecommerce-digital-marketing-101/"},{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b0","name":"SMS Marketing Best Practices","slug":"sms-marketing-best-practices","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/sms-marketing-best-practices/"},{"id":"6130c0dd4b6af0003b03536e","name":"Blog","slug":"blog","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/blog/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b1","name":"eCommerce Digital Marketing 101","slug":"ecommerce-digital-marketing-101","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/ecommerce-digital-marketing-101/"},"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/effective-lead-generation-and-nurturing-with-sms-marketing/","excerpt":"If you run an ecommerce business, you don’t need us to tell you how crucial\ngenerating leads is for achieving sales.

And the most effective way to do that is to optimize your conversion rate by using SMS and email marketing together.</p><h2 id=\"how-do-you-optimize-conversion-rates\"><strong>How do you optimize conversion rates?</strong></h2><p>Optimizing conversion rates for your digital marketing depends on your success in 4 areas:</p><ul><li><strong>Ensuring your message is relevant to your usersMotivating your users to become leads</strong></li><li><strong>Interacting effectively with your leads</strong></li><li><strong>Building a strong relationship with customers</strong></li></ul><h2 id=\"ensuring-your-message-is-relevant-to-your-users\"><strong>Ensuring your message is relevant to your users</strong></h2><p><em>How: </em>Personalization, automation, and customer segmentation<br></p><p><em>Why: </em><br>a) Better conversion - 98% of marketers state personalization advances customer relationships<br>b) Customer expectations - 62% of consumers expect personalization and 52% will switch brands if a company doesn’t personalize</p><p>American consumers are exposed to around 3-7 ads every minute of every day.

Manual segmentation is laborious, prone to errors, and limits the level of granularity available. Marketing platforms today automatically segment different classes of customers, and can send targeted communications to them at specific triggers - either after a period of time has elapsed, or after some customer action.</p><p>These platforms usually rely on SMS or email as the default channels, and each has its own relative pros and cons. Using an integrated and automated approach, you can ensure that your audience receives relevant communication at the right time and through the most effective channel.</p><p>For instance, an instant follow-up SMS to an abandoned cart along with a reminder email after 24 hours will lower the number of times potential leads abandon their ecommerce carts - which happens ~70% of the time.</p><p>(Source: “<a href=\"https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate\">41 Cart Abandonment Rate Statistics - Cart &amp; Checkout</a>”, Baymard Institute, 2018)</p><p>Read more: <a href=\"http://blog.voyagetext.com/guides-to-sms-marketing/\">Voyage offers marketing automation and customer segmentation on its platform</a></p><h2 id=\"motivating-your-users-to-become-leads\"><strong>Motivating your users to become leads</strong></h2><p><em>How:</em> Targeted promotions, discounts, and special offers<br></p><p><em>Why:</em> <br>a) Better conversion - 92% of consumers reported using a coupon or promotion code while shopping in 2017<br>b) Customer expectations - 79% of both Millennials and Gen-Xers want a robust loyalty or discount program</p><p>The basic discount continues to be a universal and potent weapon in the arsenal of the marketer, even for digital-first millennials.

If you don’t already have a ready distribution list, you can use SMS and email offers to get sign-ups and build one. Once you have a ready audience, all you need to do is decide how to pitch your offer effectively.</p><p>The most effective promotional campaigns are those which add value to consumers, and meet customers where they are. Existing customers shouldn’t see products they bought being offered at a discount later on, but should get loyalty discounts on accessories or other products that are similar to their initial purchase. For perishable items or products with a particular life cycle, a reminder to restock at the right time works better. For customers who abandoned a cart, a discount on the product might motivate them to buy.

It has a ~4x higher open rate, and click-through rates up to 15x higher. Sending a confirmation message is the best way to contact a lead in &lt;5 minutes after they sign up. Asking them to choose a time to be contacted by a salesperson makes the sales process more efficient and more likely to end in a purchase.</p><p>Sometimes, this isn’t enough - you need to follow up to follow through. An email that goes out 24 hours after the initial contact will catch leads that might still be active, and the combination of a quick response and a channel to catch stragglers will raise your conversion rate.</p><p>(Source: “<a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/resources/email-marketing-benchmarks/\">Email Marketing Benchmarks</a>”, MailChimp, 2018)</p><p>(Source: “<a href=\"https://www.shiftcomm.com/blog/what-is-the-open-rate-of-sms-text-messaging/\">What is the Open Rate of SMS Text Messaging</a>”, Shift Communications, 08/29/2015; “How effective is SMS marketing in 2018”, SMSGlobal, 2018)</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.voyagetext.com/sms-for-business/\">How to build an effective lead response management system using Voyage</a></p><h2 id=\"building-a-strong-relationship-with-customers\"><strong>Building a strong relationship with customers</strong></h2><p><em>How: </em>Brand building through Drip Marketing, sales through remarketing</p><p><em>Why:</em> <br>a) Remarketing cuts Customer Acquisition costs by 44%<br>b) Drip campaigns generate 80% more sales at 33% the cost</p><p>The first and most critical step in establishing a good relationship with a customer is establishing brand recall.

Emails are longer, can carry richer media, and have a better UX overall. This is why people use email-based drip campaigns to get in touch with customers regularly, providing a channel to receive feedback and offer positive customer service.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.voyagetext.com/digital-marketing/\">Creating a drip marketing campaign using Voyage</a></p><p>This is also a great way to remarket your other products and services. Drip campaigns offer your existing customers a critical touchpoint; using marketing automation platforms to build a robust time-bound campaign builds a great system for customer service.

This is because email and SMS bring complementary offerings to the table. As a channel, email offers greater storytelling and branding potential. But by its nature, it isn’t something that people constantly check or are connected to.

Choosing the one that’s right for you involves deciding which features and pricing best suit your specific needs. Here are some considerations when making your choice:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Does it require coding?</strong> Choose a platform with an easy-to-use editor. Your platform should be built for marketers, not for developers.</li><li><strong>Is it automated? </strong>The most useful platforms will allow for automated customer segmentation and building a calendar for a forward-looking plan and campaign.</li><li><strong>Can you optimize? </strong>The best platforms will allow you to track the effectiveness of different messages, and collect customer-level data and click information.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Build your distribution list</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have chosen a service provider, the next step is to build your audience. Most businesses ask users to share their email addresses to receive offers or promotions. This usually comes at the end of them making a purchase, or as an opt-in field on the website. However, this doesn’t always have a lot of traction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other ways to get opt-ins are the same as with email &#8211; nothing makes a customer willing to share their email address or phone number as much as a discount does. You can leverage your social media presence as well, offering discount codes to people for sharing their phone numbers and email addresses. You can also offer free content, such as a webinar or ebook, to build your distribution list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Ensure compliance before you text</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t just bad marketing to SMS someone without their permission &#8211; it is against the law to send promotional digital communication to someone without them expressly opting in. Therefore, you should make 100% sure that you have a digital record of customers who choose to opt-in, and that you additionally provide an unsubscribe option with every marketing SMS that you send.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Craft the right message</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You should be set to send out your first marketing SMS at this stage. However, it’s important to take a step back and take a big-picture look at the whole campaign first. Think through the user journey and your audience segments &#8211; craft campaigns to make leads buy, to get feedback from present customers, and upsell to long-term users. Your goal shouldn’t be to communicate for the sake of building the brand. SMS marketing is purpose-driven, and each message you send should have a clear purpose and a clear and actionable expectation from the recipient. Build out your automated campaigns, and continually measure their effectiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Keep it direct and simple</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SMS as a medium is more personal than email. People reach for their smartphones as soon as they wake up, and the mobile phone is the default channel for one-on-one communication for most individuals. The limited character count in SMS also means that brevity is essential in getting your message across. In other words, keep it short and simple, with a clear CTA that spurs the recipients into clicking or reacting the way you want them to.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->","comment_id":"446","feature_image":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2019/04/computer-smartphone-hand-screen-person-blur-914018-pxhere.com-1-300x200-1.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2019-04-11T14:39:14.000+00:00","updated_at":"2021-08-27T16:28:51.000+00:00","published_at":"2019-04-11T14:39:14.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"authors":[{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"}],"tags":[{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b0","name":"SMS Marketing Best Practices","slug":"sms-marketing-best-practices","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/sms-marketing-best-practices/"},{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b1","name":"eCommerce Digital Marketing 101","slug":"ecommerce-digital-marketing-101","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/ecommerce-digital-marketing-101/"},{"id":"6130c0dd4b6af0003b03536e","name":"Blog","slug":"blog","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/blog/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b0","name":"SMS Marketing Best Practices","slug":"sms-marketing-best-practices","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/sms-marketing-best-practices/"},"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/effective-sms-marketing-for-ecommerce/","excerpt":"Email marketing has long been the bread-and-butter of direct digital marketing,\nbut it’s quickly losing ground.
