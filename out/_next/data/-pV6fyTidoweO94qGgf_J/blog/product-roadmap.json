And we always will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure a lack of bias in our assessment, we are currently completing a full audit of the Voyage compliance program, conducted independently by third-party legal counsel. We’ll publish the results here when we have them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SMS compliance and deliverability protocols are constantly evolving.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, we have already witnessed the impact of the deprecation of shared short codes and the introduction of 10DLC on an SMS marketing platform’s ability to adapt and evolve quickly. <strong>We have dedicated resources consistently canvassing the regulatory landscape,</strong> and we always embed relevant updates into our service and product accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage&#8217;s goal is to protect brands to the fullest extent possible when it comes to their SMS marketing and commerce program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder, <strong>Voyage clients have access to the following compliance-related features:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Robust reporting capabilities, to ensure they know when and by which method every subscriber has opted-in to an SMS program.</li><li>Manual unsubscribe of any customer, as requested in the Settings panel.</li><li>Double opt-in activation for certain list building methods that require it, including keyed-in entry and keyword list building campaigns</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, we’ve received a few client requests to implement a &#8220;fuzzy opt-out&#8221; feature. This is <strong>not </strong>a hard requirement governed by the TCPA, CTIA, etc. However, as we always take product feedback seriously, <strong>we are working on shipping a best-in-class Voyage version of fuzzy opt-out</strong> before the end of the month – that will be more accurate than those of other SMS platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge with any sort of fuzzy logic is to not inadvertently unsubscribe someone who does not have that intention. We have direct evidence there are issues with this feature in other SMS platforms, including (ironically) the competitor making claims against us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1206\" srcset=\"/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example.png 550w, /content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example-300x282.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /><figcaption>An example of an inadvertent opt-out due to imprecise fuzzy logic. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage Fuzzy Opt-out will be smarter about ensuring that subscribers who are opted-in do not inadvertently unsubscribe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a customer texts: &#8220;I would like to stop my order. Can you help me?,&#8221; this would not inaccurately unsubscribe the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, it would generate a prompt to open a CS ticket and/or show up in our Live Conversions panel for response. In fact, carriers have explicitly stated that automatic opt-out within a use case such as this is “invalid.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-1024x558.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1207\" srcset=\"/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-1024x558.png 1024w, /content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-300x164.png 300w, /content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-768x419.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption><em>Voyage keyword and opt-out trigger logic tree.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we have also anecdotally heard that this same aforementioned <strong>competitor is claiming that multi-message drips are non-compliant</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also false.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality is that Voyage employs a more robust technology than our competitors, that enables multi-message drip automations that drive higher conversions and unlocks additional revenue from high-intent customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only written guidance that exists in this regard references best practices, provided at present by T-Mobile only. The T-Mobile code of conduct suggests that one alert should be sent per abandoned cart within 48 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To clarify, <strong>this is <em>not</em> a requirement by official governing bodies such as the TCPA and CTIA</strong>. We have confirmed this with two of the largest SMS message aggregators, who have decades of relationship experience with carriers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, at time of writing, <strong>sending a multi-message cart abandonment series will <em>not</em> result in a fine</strong> and is unlikely to result in any sort of broad message filtering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, we are adding the ability to segment by a recipient&#8217;s carrier in our segmentation builder. If desired, brands can add a T-Mobile filter to their cart abandonment drip automation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as always, brands can modify (and/or request that our service team modify) their cart abandonment automation series on the UI, to be single or multi-message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are confident that Voyage offers the most robust SMS marketing and message commerce solution in the market. Our platform will only continue to get more powerful over time, as we continue to partner with leading eCommerce brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder of <strong>what brands get with Voyage</strong>, that other platforms may not offer:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>More robust segmentation, including event and attribute metadata drill-down</li><li>Custom events on the UI, for use in drip automations and segmentation</li><li>Multi-message drip automations</li><li>Flexible, advanced reporting with Voyage Report Builder</li><li>Dynamic Click to Buy, for browse abandon, cart abandon and checkout abandon drip automations</li><li>Personalized variables from event data and subscriber attributes in list building, drip automations and marketing campaigns</li><li>Fully custom, hand-crafted, on-brand modals that drive quicker list growth than templated and semi-custom modals</li><li>Personalized conversational commerce at scale through Live Conversions, including as a Voyage managed service (in beta, available for wide release in early Q3)</li><li>And more&#8230;with more to come.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These features offer brands the flexibility and precision to drive maximal revenue, hyper-personalize messages at scale, and grow + engage their communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we continue to expand our team, including by growing our product and engineering functions, the Voyage platform will continue to evolve and advance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We are committed to offering clients the most cutting edge solutions that SMS marketing and message commerce has to offer.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rev Reddy</strong><br />CEO of Voyage SMS</p>\n<!--kg-card-end:

And <strong><em>message commerce</em></strong> is the right tool for exploring it – especially for brands with an eye on the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Emergence of Message Commerce: Filling a Gap</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first purchase on mobile occurred in 2008. Although the channel has obviously proved a potent driver of growth, brands face a few key challenges (even today) in pursuing scalable eCommerce success outside of desktop environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, to the lament of many marketers, most web sites are still not built with a mobile-first mindset. At the same time, and likely related to this, the explosive growth in browsing on mobile hasn&#8217;t kept pace with purchasing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until now, this has made mobile a lucrative channel for generating leads, but not necessarily for increasing conversions in like proportion. As a shopping experience, mobile can seem inferior to a consumer looking for more versatility, or speed, or just an easier purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But advancements in SMS eCommerce are closing this gap on mobile – fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SMS Evolution: From One-Way Blasts to Full Connectivity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Message commerce is in many ways already here, but the true potential of the channel has only begun to reveal itself to leading-edge marketers and engagement specialists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Voyage SMS, we help leading eCommerce brands meet their customers where they are, not only on their phones but in their texts messages, where open rates remain extraordinarily higher than email (as high as 98% to 15%).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see our clients succeeding with conversions everyday. As we&#8217;ve worked in tandem with them on their sales and engagement campaigns, it&#8217;s become clear that together we&#8217;re witnessing the evolution of SMS eCommerce into message commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the very near future, this will manifest as brands servicing their customers more fully on their terms, offering a flexible, individualized, full-cycle experience on SMS – that benefits everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Text-to-Buy sales flows</em></strong> will speed up checkouts and reduce abandoned carts.</li><li><strong><em>Digital wallets</em></strong>, attached to the much more reliable identifier of a phone number, will reduce complexity with conversions, delivering a more seamless experience for customers and fostering greater goodwill and loyalty for brands.</li><li><strong><em>Customers can text brands</em></strong> their questions, get them answered, and receive the sort of service a desktop interface can&#8217;t offer so easily and that web apps aren&#8217;t often focused on providing.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, message commerce is about catching sales pipelines up to consumer experience and expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Message Commerce Is About Quality and Efficiency</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a sample funnel:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A user sees an ad on Instagram</li><li>Swiping up on the ad opens an SMS message</li><li>User sends the message, your brand replies</li><li>The user replies &#8220;Buy,&#8221; and/or you answer their questions</li><li>Payment/Shipping details are captured and confirmed via app integration, or later, as part of their digital wallet</li><li>Receipt sent to customer, with a planned delay to allow for shipping and payment adjustments</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This keeps transactions simple, highly portable, and versatile among platforms and integrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, brands move from struggling to secure and identify leads on mobile for later desktop conversion –&nbsp;to guiding consumers from interest to purchase with less effort, right within their messages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Future Use Cases: Data-Driven Growth</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Already, we&#8217;re seeing early versions of this sort of buyer engagement pay dividends for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Utilizing SMS to close the gap between mobile browsing and desktop conversion ensures that brands&#8217; highest-engagement marketing channel is more closely aligned with their sales channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>For single SKU or low assortment brands</strong> that sell through direct channels, offer basic subscriptions, or want to upsell or maintain reorders, message commerce can lead to incredible growth.</li><li><strong>Retailers and restaurants</strong> will soon be able to offer contactless checkout via SMS. Customers can pay their bill by texting a number on their receipt.</li><li><strong>Non-profits and political organizations</strong> can collect donations more quickly, and at greater scale.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In all these cases, brands and organizations leveraging message commerce will continue to build data-driven customer lists and segments that can be immediately applied to further optimize and grow sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is only the beginning for message commerce</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Take Your Brand Into The Future with Message Commerce</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology required to secure this future is already here, and marketers and sellers looking to stay ahead would do well to keep pace with this exciting new frontier in eCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With our best-in-class SMS eCommerce platform and our dedicated experts blazing the trail, Voyage SMS will continue to lead the way towards message commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Interested in partnering with

SMS marketing is no different.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may or may not have heard, but the SMS marketing world is undergoing a change in how texts are delivered. Our guess is if you have heard, you are likely only hearing an incomplete story.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage has spent countless hours scrubbing through CTIA and TCPA protocols and promulgations and talking to CPaaS experts, carrier conduits and aggregators, and TCPA lawyers. Compliance and deliverability are the absolute highest priority for Voyage, and we want to ensure brands – whether Voyage clients or not – are in the best position to (1) stay fully compliant; (2) ensure deliverability of their text messages; and (3) maximize ROAS.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Actually Happening?</strong><br /></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gone are the days of the almighty shared short code.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All SMS platforms loved utilizing shared short codes. Why? Because shared short codes have historically provided the highest level of throughput (100+ msgs/second) at the best deliverability rate (near 100%) at the lowest marginal economic cost for brands ($0).&nbsp;<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carriers are beginning to grandfather out shared short codes with a requirement for SMS platforms to submit migration plans by March 1, 2021. The reasoning behind this is twofold:<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Carriers want to more readily be able to manage communication sent for Application-to-Person (A2P) traffic to monitor for terms of use violations (e.g. messaging without explicit opt-in protocols)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. There has been an influx of non-compliant SMS providers in the market, putting brands at risk of a significant per-message fine. A great example of a non-compliant message is sending an abandoned checkout message to a consumer who has not explicitly opted in previously (which we help protect you from!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any text messages sent from a business that are informational or promotional in nature are automatically rendered “A2P” by the carriers. So yes, the above applies to you if you are a brand.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, with shared short codes going away, how will brands be able to send text messages to their consumers who love receiving these timely and personalized alerts?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>New Number Formats</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the phase out of shared short codes, there are several number infrastructure solutions for brands to be aware of. Voyage has noted which numbers are and are not sanctioned by the carriers for A2P traffic. Again, as a business sending marketing messages, brands are automatically defined as A2P.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Dedicated Short Code (SANCTIONED for A2P)</strong> – Brands can utilize a dedicated short code, which costs $500 per month at an absolute minimum (most aggregators add a $500 short-code monitoring fee on top of this to ensure ongoing compliance). This looks, acts, and behaves in the exact same manner as a shared short code, except no other brand will co-occupy said short code.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Toll-Free and High Throughput Toll-Free (SANCTIONED for A2P)</strong>: The next best alternative to a dedicated short code. Toll-free numbers (1-800) maintain similarly high deliverability rates. Throughput can be extended to match short codes, but at a price that is pro-ratably set based on throughput increases. The only real difference between high-throughput toll-free numbers and short codes is the number format. Toll-free numbers will be supported for free by Voyage.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>10 Digit Long Code, or 10DLC (SANCTIONED for A2P, but not operational)</strong>: You have likely or will likely hear a lot about “10DLC”. However, this has yet to be rolled out by all of the carriers. Only Verizon has rolled it out currently. AT&amp;T is rolling it out in March 2021, with TMO/Sprint shortly behind. However, there are major issues that the carriers need to work through before 10DLC can become a good solution for brands. For instance, carriers necessitate that all campaigns must be pre-approved by them prior to sending within the 10DLC infrastructure. As you can imagine, this is not ideal for instantaneous automated messages, such as abandoned checkout drips! For these reasons, Voyage strongly recommends against utilizing 10DLC at this time. It is Voyage’s hope that within the next 12 months, these 10DLC issues will be worked out, and that this number infrastructure can effectively replace shared short codes as the primary economical format for message delivery.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>10 Digit Local (NOT SANCTIONED for A2P)</strong>:<strong> </strong>10 digit local looks and feels like 10DLC (and looks like a normal number!). However, the carriers have not sanctioned this for A2P traffic, reserving it for only P2P traffic (Person-to-Person). As such, the carriers have been filtering messages over 10 digit local, resulting in poor deliverability. This filtering will significantly increase starting on March 1, 2021. Because of this, for the time being, Voyage will not be supporting 10 digit local. This decision ensures that the messages you pay for actually reach your consumers.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bonus Material</em>: make sure your SMS marketing provider is not spreading your A2P text messages over hundreds of 10 digit local numbers. This process – colloquially referred to as “snow shoeing” – is strictly prohibited by the carriers. If caught, the carriers reserve the right to suspend brands’ A2P text messaging capabilities.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Summary:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to utilize SMS marketing – and we absolutely think you should! – ensure your provider is up to speed, compliant, and communicative with you about what is happening.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage takes compliance and deliverability quite seriously.

Choosing the one that’s right for you involves deciding which features and pricing best suit your specific needs. Here are some considerations when making your choice:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Does it require coding?</strong> Choose a platform with an easy-to-use editor. Your platform should be built for marketers, not for developers.</li><li><strong>Is it automated? </strong>The most useful platforms will allow for automated customer segmentation and building a calendar for a forward-looking plan and campaign.</li><li><strong>Can you optimize? </strong>The best platforms will allow you to track the effectiveness of different messages, and collect customer-level data and click information.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Build your distribution list</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have chosen a service provider, the next step is to build your audience. Most businesses ask users to share their email addresses to receive offers or promotions. This usually comes at the end of them making a purchase, or as an opt-in field on the website. However, this doesn’t always have a lot of traction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other ways to get opt-ins are the same as with email &#8211; nothing makes a customer willing to share their email address or phone number as much as a discount does. You can leverage your social media presence as well, offering discount codes to people for sharing their phone numbers and email addresses. You can also offer free content, such as a webinar or ebook, to build your distribution list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Ensure compliance before you text</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t just bad marketing to SMS someone without their permission &#8211; it is against the law to send promotional digital communication to someone without them expressly opting in. Therefore, you should make 100% sure that you have a digital record of customers who choose to opt-in, and that you additionally provide an unsubscribe option with every marketing SMS that you send.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Craft the right message</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You should be set to send out your first marketing SMS at this stage. However, it’s important to take a step back and take a big-picture look at the whole campaign first. Think through the user journey and your audience segments &#8211; craft campaigns to make leads buy, to get feedback from present customers, and upsell to long-term users. Your goal shouldn’t be to communicate for the sake of building the brand. SMS marketing is purpose-driven, and each message you send should have a clear purpose and a clear and actionable expectation from the recipient. Build out your automated campaigns, and continually measure their effectiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Keep it direct and simple</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SMS as a medium is more personal than email. People reach for their smartphones as soon as they wake up, and the mobile phone is the default channel for one-on-one communication for most individuals. The limited character count in SMS also means that brevity is essential in getting your message across. In other words, keep it short and simple, with a clear CTA that spurs the recipients into clicking or reacting the way you want them to.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->","comment_id":"446","feature_image":"/content/images/wordpress/2019/04/computer-smartphone-hand-screen-person-blur-914018-pxhere.com-1-300x200-1.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2019-04-11T14:39:14.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-12T18:49:17.000+00:00","published_at":"2019-04-11T14:39:14.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"authors":[{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"}],"tags":[],"primary_author":{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"},"primary_tag":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/effective-sms-marketing-for-ecommerce/","excerpt":"Email marketing has long been the bread-and-butter of direct digital marketing,\nbut it’s quickly losing ground.
