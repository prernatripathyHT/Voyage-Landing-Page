Many of these are about cultivating LTV, which is more important than ever as SMS continues to grow as a channel.</p><ol><li><strong>Welcome Series:</strong> Include an image reflecting your brand's voice and tone to build a deeper relationship with your customers. Particularly with list building, you should have significant \"margin\" to include an MMS. Images can directly increase initial conversion rates.</li><li><strong>Brand Building &amp; Awareness Campaigns:</strong> Brands should engage with their subscriber list ideally once per week, to keep their SMS subscriber lists warm. Not doing so can risk your lists feeling exploited only for sales and conversions. GIFs/MMS and emojis (where it fits with your brand voice) are often best used to build brand equity with prospective and current customers in an authentic way.</li><li><strong>Product Launches &amp; Waitlists:</strong> Showing the product with a visual image increases conversion rates. If you are promoting a broader product line, create a GIF (Voyage GIF Builder Coming Soon) to highlight multiple SKUs.</li><li><strong>All Conversion Drips:</strong> For Abandoned Browse, Cart, Checkout, and Back-in-Stock notifications, inclusion of a dynamic product image materially increases conversion rates for high intent customers. You can use Voyage's Dynamic Product Image option in your drips to automate this.</li></ol><p>As BFCM approaches, hopefully these tips can help get your creative engine running on how to best leverage MMS.</p><p>We look forward to seeing the results of your MMS sends in the near future, and we believe you'll be happy to see them, too.</p><h3 id=\"new-to-voyage-sms\">New to Voyage SMS?</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.voyagesms.com/get-started\">Schedule a demo</a> to learn more.</p>","comment_id":"6173011155eac40048a10646","feature_image":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/2021/10/MMS_blog_social.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-10-22T18:21:05.000+00:00","updated_at":"2021-10-22T18:33:01.000+00:00","published_at":"2021-10-22T18:33:01.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"At Voyage, we take your account performance very seriously — ROAS is a key metric in our approach to client success.

Brands","slug":"temp-slug-38","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<h3><strong>TL;DR: Most Can Still Utilize SMS with Proper Age Gating</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sex, Hate, Alcohol, Firearms, and Tobacco. And text messaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For so-called S.H.A.F.T. companies, keeping in compliance with SMS legislation and carrier rules can seem daunting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Referred to by many businesses as a new “wild west,” in 2021 there’s been a lot of talk (and some confusion) about what is and isn’t permitted for SMS eCommerce, if you operate a brand that might fall under one of these categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Voyage SMS, it’s our mission to help a diversity of clients best serve their customers, so let’s dig into the overall situation with SMS and S.H.A.F.T. brands, and clear up the confusion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, you can be sure to not only remain in compliance but also pursue your business goals through SMS – worry-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let’s move past one common misconception.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Rules Haven’t Changed – But Enforcement Has Shifted</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent chatter about SMS compliance updates are in actuality not about new legislative changes applying to S.H.A.F.T companies. Such rules have been in effect for a while, and have remained largely the same for some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What <em>has</em> changed is carrier enforcement. Carriers are simply paying more attention to whether S.H.A.F.T. brands are following federal rules under the FCC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This increased scrutiny has for related reasons coincided with the grandfathering out of shared short codes. With more brands texting, carriers want to more easily gather detailed information on who is and who is not complying with regulation. You can’t do that when brands are sharing short codes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the facts. The rumors circulating suggest a more dramatic – and incorrect – interpretation: that S.H.A.F.T. companies are being restricted from SMS marketing altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>That’s not the case – with one exception*</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Solution: Proper Age Gating</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage SMS was built to flexibly serve all marketers’ unique needs. Just as no consumer is the same, no brand is the same. This remains a primary driver of our product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, our custom-designed lead capture forms ensure immediate compliance for all S.H.A.F.T. brands. Consumers must provide a valid age to opt-in to our text messaging platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, look at how we’re executing proper age gating for Winc:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM-1024x536.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1228\" srcset=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM-1024x536.png 1024w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM-300x157.png 300w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM-768x402.png 768w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For any brand leaders that want to be doubly sure, you don’t have to just take our word for it.

And we always will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure a lack of bias in our assessment, we are currently completing a full audit of the Voyage compliance program, conducted independently by third-party legal counsel. We’ll publish the results here when we have them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SMS compliance and deliverability protocols are constantly evolving.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, we have already witnessed the impact of the deprecation of shared short codes and the introduction of 10DLC on an SMS marketing platform’s ability to adapt and evolve quickly. <strong>We have dedicated resources consistently canvassing the regulatory landscape,</strong> and we always embed relevant updates into our service and product accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage&#8217;s goal is to protect brands to the fullest extent possible when it comes to their SMS marketing and commerce program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder, <strong>Voyage clients have access to the following compliance-related features:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Robust reporting capabilities, to ensure they know when and by which method every subscriber has opted-in to an SMS program.</li><li>Manual unsubscribe of any customer, as requested in the Settings panel.</li><li>Double opt-in activation for certain list building methods that require it, including keyed-in entry and keyword list building campaigns</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, we’ve received a few client requests to implement a &#8220;fuzzy opt-out&#8221; feature. This is <strong>not </strong>a hard requirement governed by the TCPA, CTIA, etc. However, as we always take product feedback seriously, <strong>we are working on shipping a best-in-class Voyage version of fuzzy opt-out</strong> before the end of the month – that will be more accurate than those of other SMS platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge with any sort of fuzzy logic is to not inadvertently unsubscribe someone who does not have that intention. We have direct evidence there are issues with this feature in other SMS platforms, including (ironically) the competitor making claims against us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1206\" srcset=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example.png 550w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example-300x282.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /><figcaption>An example of an inadvertent opt-out due to imprecise fuzzy logic. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage Fuzzy Opt-out will be smarter about ensuring that subscribers who are opted-in do not inadvertently unsubscribe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a customer texts: &#8220;I would like to stop my order. Can you help me?,&#8221; this would not inaccurately unsubscribe the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, it would generate a prompt to open a CS ticket and/or show up in our Live Conversions panel for response. In fact, carriers have explicitly stated that automatic opt-out within a use case such as this is “invalid.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-1024x558.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1207\" srcset=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-1024x558.png 1024w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-300x164.png 300w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-768x419.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption><em>Voyage keyword and opt-out trigger logic tree.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we have also anecdotally heard that this same aforementioned <strong>competitor is claiming that multi-message drips are non-compliant</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also false.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality is that Voyage employs a more robust technology than our competitors, that enables multi-message drip automations that drive higher conversions and unlocks additional revenue from high-intent customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only written guidance that exists in this regard references best practices, provided at present by T-Mobile only. The T-Mobile code of conduct suggests that one alert should be sent per abandoned cart within 48 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To clarify, <strong>this is <em>not</em> a requirement by official governing bodies such as the TCPA and CTIA</strong>. We have confirmed this with two of the largest SMS message aggregators, who have decades of relationship experience with carriers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, at time of writing, <strong>sending a multi-message cart abandonment series will <em>not</em> result in a fine</strong> and is unlikely to result in any sort of broad message filtering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, we are adding the ability to segment by a recipient&#8217;s carrier in our segmentation builder. If desired, brands can add a T-Mobile filter to their cart abandonment drip automation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as always, brands can modify (and/or request that our service team modify) their cart abandonment automation series on the UI, to be single or multi-message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are confident that Voyage offers the most robust SMS marketing and message commerce solution in the market. Our platform will only continue to get more powerful over time, as we continue to partner with leading eCommerce brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder of <strong>what brands get with Voyage</strong>, that other platforms may not offer:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>More robust segmentation, including event and attribute metadata drill-down</li><li>Custom events on the UI, for use in drip automations and segmentation</li><li>Multi-message drip automations</li><li>Flexible, advanced reporting with Voyage Report Builder</li><li>Dynamic Click to Buy, for browse abandon, cart abandon and checkout abandon drip automations</li><li>Personalized variables from event data and subscriber attributes in list building, drip automations and marketing campaigns</li><li>Fully custom, hand-crafted, on-brand modals that drive quicker list growth than templated and semi-custom modals</li><li>Personalized conversational commerce at scale through Live Conversions, including as a Voyage managed service (in beta, available for wide release in early Q3)</li><li>And more&#8230;with more to come.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These features offer brands the flexibility and precision to drive maximal revenue, hyper-personalize messages at scale, and grow + engage their communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we continue to expand our team, including by growing our product and engineering functions, the Voyage platform will continue to evolve and advance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We are committed to offering clients the most cutting edge solutions that SMS marketing and message commerce has to offer.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rev Reddy</strong><br />CEO of Voyage SMS</p>\n<!--kg-card-end:

And <strong><em>message commerce</em></strong> is the right tool for exploring it – especially for brands with an eye on the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Emergence of Message Commerce: Filling a Gap</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first purchase on mobile occurred in 2008. Although the channel has obviously proved a potent driver of growth, brands face a few key challenges (even today) in pursuing scalable eCommerce success outside of desktop environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, to the lament of many marketers, most web sites are still not built with a mobile-first mindset. At the same time, and likely related to this, the explosive growth in browsing on mobile hasn&#8217;t kept pace with purchasing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until now, this has made mobile a lucrative channel for generating leads, but not necessarily for increasing conversions in like proportion. As a shopping experience, mobile can seem inferior to a consumer looking for more versatility, or speed, or just an easier purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But advancements in SMS eCommerce are closing this gap on mobile – fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SMS Evolution: From One-Way Blasts to Full Connectivity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Message commerce is in many ways already here, but the true potential of the channel has only begun to reveal itself to leading-edge marketers and engagement specialists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Voyage SMS, we help leading eCommerce brands meet their customers where they are, not only on their phones but in their texts messages, where open rates remain extraordinarily higher than email (as high as 98% to 15%).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see our clients succeeding with conversions everyday. As we&#8217;ve worked in tandem with them on their sales and engagement campaigns, it&#8217;s become clear that together we&#8217;re witnessing the evolution of SMS eCommerce into message commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the very near future, this will manifest as brands servicing their customers more fully on their terms, offering a flexible, individualized, full-cycle experience on SMS – that benefits everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Text-to-Buy sales flows</em></strong> will speed up checkouts and reduce abandoned carts.</li><li><strong><em>Digital wallets</em></strong>, attached to the much more reliable identifier of a phone number, will reduce complexity with conversions, delivering a more seamless experience for customers and fostering greater goodwill and loyalty for brands.</li><li><strong><em>Customers can text brands</em></strong> their questions, get them answered, and receive the sort of service a desktop interface can&#8217;t offer so easily and that web apps aren&#8217;t often focused on providing.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, message commerce is about catching sales pipelines up to consumer experience and expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Message Commerce Is About Quality and Efficiency</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a sample funnel:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A user sees an ad on Instagram</li><li>Swiping up on the ad opens an SMS message</li><li>User sends the message, your brand replies</li><li>The user replies &#8220;Buy,&#8221; and/or you answer their questions</li><li>Payment/Shipping details are captured and confirmed via app integration, or later, as part of their digital wallet</li><li>Receipt sent to customer, with a planned delay to allow for shipping and payment adjustments</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This keeps transactions simple, highly portable, and versatile among platforms and integrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, brands move from struggling to secure and identify leads on mobile for later desktop conversion –&nbsp;to guiding consumers from interest to purchase with less effort, right within their messages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Future Use Cases: Data-Driven Growth</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Already, we&#8217;re seeing early versions of this sort of buyer engagement pay dividends for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Utilizing SMS to close the gap between mobile browsing and desktop conversion ensures that brands&#8217; highest-engagement marketing channel is more closely aligned with their sales channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>For single SKU or low assortment brands</strong> that sell through direct channels, offer basic subscriptions, or want to upsell or maintain reorders, message commerce can lead to incredible growth.</li><li><strong>Retailers and restaurants</strong> will soon be able to offer contactless checkout via SMS. Customers can pay their bill by texting a number on their receipt.</li><li><strong>Non-profits and political organizations</strong> can collect donations more quickly, and at greater scale.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In all these cases, brands and organizations leveraging message commerce will continue to build data-driven customer lists and segments that can be immediately applied to further optimize and grow sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is only the beginning for message commerce</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Take Your Brand Into The Future with Message Commerce</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology required to secure this future is already here, and marketers and sellers looking to stay ahead would do well to keep pace with this exciting new frontier in eCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With our best-in-class SMS eCommerce platform and our dedicated experts blazing the trail, Voyage SMS will continue to lead the way towards message commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Interested in partnering with

This makes SMS more effective for promotional campaigns and special discounts, as brands can ensure that their customers never miss a good deal or offer.</p><p>Brands can leverage this engagement to make sure that consumers get timely notifications for confirming their orders, acknowledging payment, and tracking their deliveries. SMS is also useful in helping brands <a href=\"http://blog.voyagetext.com/guides-to-sms-marketing/text-messaging-abandoned-cart/\">recover their abandoned carts more effectively</a>.</p><h2 id=\"the-solution\"><strong>The Solution</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/\">Voyage</a> helped an ecommerce client build a text marketing campaign as a part of a 4-day sale, generating $360k in revenue through SMS. This represented 30% of the total revenue generated from the brand’s website during the sale. Our client used the <a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/product\">Voyage dashboard</a> to build optimized and targeted messages for their audience based on the analytical insights generated on the platform, earning nearly $6.55 per message. These returns were considerably higher than the ecommerce industry benchmark of $0.08 revenue per recipient.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/O769NiUSn_6TFCHukUk0djCkj7C7SrUzxUTilqcn5Nv9W8vB-NeBVu4LbkDaGY5HhKGHda8S_LM_n_LvQXcfEFtZqo-_kNKVFOMsa1Tw6QBirouGNgHkMiNU_A3nIuswTGc5mOWx\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>The company was able to get nearly 10k customers to opt-in to receiving SMS, and the company's 'secret sale' helped drive 1400+ orders at a 16% conversion rate.

Bulk SMS marketing has much lower set-up and running costs, which can allow small businesses to launch and execute campaigns at only a fraction of the cost compared to other marketing channels. With SMS marketing, you can reach 1000 customers in a matter of seconds for as little as $20 with a conversion rate of 32%.</p><p><a href=\"https://blog.voyagetext.com/sms-for-business/sms-marketing-best-roi-ecommerce-2019/\">How SMS marketing delivers the best ROI among digital channels</a></p><p>Considering the level of cost-effectiveness and returns from investment, global text marketing tools should be a major part of any startup or small business’ marketing strategy.</p><h2 id=\"text-marketing-automationpersonalize-and-customize\"><strong>Text marketing automation - personalize and customize</strong></h2><p>Another key benefit of text message marketing is automation. Businesses are increasingly looking to run their marketing campaigns on auto-pilot to reduce time, effort, and (most importantly) cost. Like email, you can automate your text marketing campaigns using messaging platforms so you can spend more time designing better campaigns and doing what you do best.</p><p>With a text marketing solution, you can also leverage data from past campaigns from your CRM, app, or website to design new campaigns or optimize ongoing ones for better outcomes. You can then use SMS to consistently engage customers with targeted and personalized messages with offers, discounts, updates on new products, etc. Using the analytics capabilities of their existing marketing management systems, you can extract insight on customer engagement to further optimize various elements of an SMS campaign, such as the timing, length, and frequency of the messages.</p><p>You can also create more detailed protocols for how you communicate with your customers. By categorizing the levels of engagement with customers based on factors such as the frequency or recency of their interaction with the brand, transaction value, and customer lifetime value, you can ensure that you’re targeting your customers appropriately.</p><h2 id=\"sms-apis\"><strong>SMS APIs</strong></h2><p>An SMS API is a software integration interface that you can use to build a personalized SMS channel for a business. The API can be seamlessly integrated with your existing digital channels to create a centralized control center for all marketing, allowing you to:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/product\">Send hundreds of SMS messages</a> instantaneously in various formats</li><li>Receive text messages</li><li>Conduct surveys among customers</li><li>Access real-time status reports on campaigns and texts</li></ul><p>Businesses that sell their products or services online can integrate SMS APIs with their websites or sales platforms to use existing customer data to personalize messages.
