<h4>Allow consumers to open support tickets in Gorgias via texting a trigger keyword to your Voyage send phone number. Use the Gorgias dashboard to communicate with consumers back and forth via SMS.</h4>



<h3>Features</h3>



<p>You can leverage the Gorgias / Voyage integration in the following ways:</p>



<ul><li>Make a top impression with your consumers directly through text message conversations</li><li>Allow consumers to text a keyword such as &#8220;ASSIST103&#8221; to open a support ticket in Gorgias</li><li>Reply to these support tickets directly in Gorgias which sends an SMS to the consumer on the same phone number they receive marketing messages</li></ul>



<h3>Benefits of integrating with Gorgias</h3>



<p>A challenge with customer support these days is it has become robotic. Finding how to contact a brand can be often difficult for customers. Then the back and forth can get lost in a swamped inbox. Now with Gorgias x Voyage, you can communicate consumers where they pay attention (SMS), reducing friction and increasing brand loyalty.</p>



<h3>Setting up the Gorgias integration<br /></h3>



<p><em>Note BEFORE starting</em>: Please ask customer support to provide you with your PERSONAL ID, you&#8217;ll need to sub it into this URL:&nbsp;<em>https://test-integrations.voyagetext.com/api/gorgias/[PERSONAL_ID]</em></p>

for emails fell from 5.4% to 3.3% between 2011 and 2018, in turn driving
increased interest in SMS marketing.

And text messaging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor so-called S.H.A.F.T. companies, keeping in compliance with SMS legislation and carrier rules can seem daunting. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eReferred to by many businesses as a new “wild west,” in 2021 there’s been a lot of talk (and some confusion) about what is and isn’t permitted for SMS eCommerce, if you operate a brand that might fall under one of these categories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Voyage SMS, it’s our mission to help a diversity of clients best serve their customers, so let’s dig into the overall situation with SMS and S.H.A.F.T. brands, and clear up the confusion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis way, you can be sure to not only remain in compliance but also pursue your business goals through SMS – worry-free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, let’s move past one common misconception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Rules Haven’t Changed – But Enforcement Has Shifted\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecent chatter about SMS compliance updates are in actuality not about new legislative changes applying to S.H.A.F.T companies.

You can’t do that when brands are sharing short codes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese are the facts.

Voyage has noted which numbers are and are not sanctioned by the carriers for A2P traffic. Again, as a business sending marketing messages, brands are automatically defined as A2P.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDedicated Short Code (SANCTIONED for A2P)\u003c/strong\u003e – Brands can utilize a dedicated short code, which costs $500 per month at an absolute minimum (most aggregators add a $500 short-code monitoring fee on top of this to ensure ongoing compliance). This looks, acts, and behaves in the exact same manner as a shared short code, except no other brand will co-occupy said short code.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eToll-Free and High Throughput Toll-Free (SANCTIONED for A2P)\u003c/strong\u003e: The next best alternative to a dedicated short code. Toll-free numbers (1-800) maintain similarly high deliverability rates. Throughput can be extended to match short codes, but at a price that is pro-ratably set based on throughput increases. The only real difference between high-throughput toll-free numbers and short codes is the number format. Toll-free numbers will be supported for free by Voyage.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10 Digit Long Code, or 10DLC (SANCTIONED for A2P, but not operational)\u003c/strong\u003e: You have likely or will likely hear a lot about “10DLC”. However, this has yet to be rolled out by all of the carriers. Only Verizon has rolled it out currently. AT\u0026amp;T is rolling it out in March 2021, with TMO/Sprint shortly behind. However, there are major issues that the carriers need to work through before 10DLC can become a good solution for brands. For instance, carriers necessitate that all campaigns must be pre-approved by them prior to sending within the 10DLC infrastructure. As you can imagine, this is not ideal for instantaneous automated messages, such as abandoned checkout drips! For these reasons, Voyage strongly recommends against utilizing 10DLC at this time. It is Voyage’s hope that within the next 12 months, these 10DLC issues will be worked out, and that this number infrastructure can effectively replace shared short codes as the primary economical format for message delivery.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10 Digit Local (NOT SANCTIONED for A2P)\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e10 digit local looks and feels like 10DLC (and looks like a normal number!). However, the carriers have not sanctioned this for A2P traffic, reserving it for only P2P traffic (Person-to-Person). As such, the carriers have been filtering messages over 10 digit local, resulting in poor deliverability. This filtering will significantly increase starting on March 1, 2021. Because of this, for the time being, Voyage will not be supporting 10 digit local. This decision ensures that the messages you pay for actually reach your consumers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBonus Material\u003c/em\u003e: make sure your SMS marketing provider is not spreading your A2P text messages over hundreds of 10 digit local numbers.

Lead generation is one of the most important elements of your inbound marketing strategy and plays a major role in converting visitors into leads and eventually into paying customers. If your business is small and relatively new, quality is always more important than quantity when it comes to \u003ca href=\"https://voyagesms.com/product\"\u003elead generation\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e do you generate more qualified leads? The simplest answer: through high-quality content. To be more specific, you need content that adds value to the customer and helps them in their buyer journey. You need the customer to be able to find you online easily, especially if your business is in the ecommerce domain. Here, inbound marketing contributes greatly to a business’s lead generation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of the most prominent and effective methods of generating leads through inbound marketing include website SEO optimization, blogs, social media posts and engagements, landing pages, videos, etc. Outbound marketing tools like paid search, banner ads, social media ads, email marketing, SMS marketing etc. create a demand for your products or services, prompting them to engage with your brand online.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter choosing the right marketing channels to use, you must define your audience. For this, you need to create a buyer persona for your potential customers, typically based on parameters such as their age and gender, their income, and from where they were sourced as a lead. Then, identify which channels your audience engages with the most. This will help you create a more accurate buyer journey to send your message on the right channels at the right time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"why-text-marketing-is-an-effective-lead-generation-tool\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy text marketing is an effective lead generation tool\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSMS marketing can be set up in almost no time - unlike email marketing, there is no design or development involved. Not only is it easier to create a message, but texts are also more likely to generate a response from recipients than emails. At least 90% of texts are opened, compared to just 20% of emails. That’s nearly five times the engagement of email and considerably more than any other channel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe simplest and most reliable way of gaining consent from your leads is to use an SMS marketing platform.

When we say personalization, we mean gathering information about leads and their interests, then marketing to them by showing them things that you know they will be interested in.

Hopefully, you have already created a comprehensive list of buyer personas and a detailed buyer journey for each. The next step is to plan how you will capture this information through landing pages and forms, using a progressive profiling approach so that conversion rates are kept high. Identify relevant pages and events that, if visited or triggered, also allow you to update lead profiles during the buyer journey. Access LinkedIn, Data.com, Hoovers and other business data sites you can use to cross-reference leads and further develop their profiles.

Think through the user journey and your audience segments \u0026#8211; craft campaigns to make leads buy, to get feedback from present customers, and upsell to long-term users. Your goal shouldn’t be to communicate for the sake of building the brand. SMS marketing is purpose-driven, and each message you send should have a clear purpose and a clear and actionable expectation from the recipient.
