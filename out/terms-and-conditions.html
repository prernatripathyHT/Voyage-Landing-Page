This agreement to arbitrate is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, including its procedural provisions, in all respects.</span></p></div><div class="tncPageHeroBanner_termsDetails__21bLp null"><p>16.2<!-- -->. <!-- -->Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.<span>Any arbitration will be conducted by the parties in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action. Unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person's or party's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, class, or private attorney general action or proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s). If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then all of section 16, other than subsection 19.8, will be null and void and neither of us will be entitled to arbitrate our dispute.</span></p></div><div class="tncPageHeroBanner_termsDetails__21bLp null"><p>16.3<!-- -->. <!-- -->Arbitration Rules.<span>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be governed by AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity, and must enforce the same limitations stated in this Agreement as a court would. The arbitrator will issue an award decision in writing but will not provide an explanation for the award unless you or Voyage Mobile requests one. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</span></p></div><div class="tncPageHeroBanner_termsDetails__21bLp null"><p>16.4<!-- -->. <!-- -->Demand for Arbitration.<span>A party who intends to arbitrate (“Claimant”) must first send to the other party (“Respondent”) a written notice, entitled “Demand for Arbitration” (“Demand”). The Demand must: (1) briefly explain the dispute; (2) provide the Claimant’s name and address, the address of the Claimant’s representative (if the Claimant has one), and the Respondent’s name and address (for Voyage Mobile, see below); (3) specify the amount of money in dispute, if applicable; (4) if the Claimant is requesting an in-person hearing, identify the requested location for the hearing; and (5) include a statement of what the Claimant wants. The Claimant must send one copy of the Demand to AAA at the same time the Claimant sends it to the Respondent. When sending a copy of the Demand to AAA, the Claimant must also include a copy of this arbitration agreement and any amendments to it (see Section 19.7) and the then current filing fee required by the AAA. The Demand must be sent to the AAA at the following address:</span><address>American Arbitration Association <br />

If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, but not your attorneys’ fees. Any request for payment of filing, administration, and arbitrator fees by Voyage Mobile should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand and Voyage Mobile will make arrangements to pay all such necessary fees directly to the AAA. In the event that the arbitrator determines that the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Voyage Mobile on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA Rules.</span></p></div><div class="tncPageHeroBanner_termsDetails__21bLp tncPageHeroBanner_highlight__1GsvZ"><p>16.6<!-- -->. <!-- -->Opt-Put Procedure.<span>If you do not wish to be bound by the arbitration provisions in this section 16 , you must notify voyage mobile in writing within 30 days of the date that you accept this agreement for the first time. You may opt out by mailing a written notice to voyage mobile at the address set forth in subsection 19.4. Your written notification to voyage mobile must include your name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number and voyage mobile account number as well as a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with voyage mobile through arbitration. If you opt out of the arbitration provisions in this section 16 , all other provisions of this agreement will continue to apply, including section 19.8, below.</span></p></div><div class="tncPageHeroBanner_termsDetails__21bLp null"><p>16.7<!-- -->. <!-- -->Amendment to Arbitration Provisions.<span>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to the arbitration provisions in this Section 16 in the future (other than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein), that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Voyage Mobile prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Voyage Mobile. We will notify you of amendments to the arbitration provisions of this Section 16 by posting the amended terms on <a href="/terms-and-conditions">www.voyagesms.com/terms-and-conditions</a>, and/or by providing notice to you by email, at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments.

This means that any claim would be decided by a judge, not a jury. Further, with respect to any claim that proceeds in a court, you and we agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, or representative or private attorney general action or proceeding.</span></p></div><div class="tncPageHeroBanner_termsDetails__21bLp null"><p>17<!-- -->. <!-- -->Miscellaneous.<span></span></p></div><div class="tncPageHeroBanner_termsDetails__21bLp null"><p>17.1<!-- -->. <!-- -->Geographic Restrictions.<span>Voyage Mobile is based in the State of California in the United States.
