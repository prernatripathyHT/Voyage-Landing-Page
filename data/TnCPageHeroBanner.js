If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, but not your attorneys’ fees. Any request for payment of filing, administration, and arbitrator fees by Voyage Mobile should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand and Voyage Mobile will make arrangements to pay all such necessary fees directly to the AAA. In the event that the arbitrator determines that the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Voyage Mobile on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA Rules.`
