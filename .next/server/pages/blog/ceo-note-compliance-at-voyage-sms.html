data-aos-duration="1500"><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>We recently learned that one of our competitors (another SMS marketing provider) is making false claims about our compliance program.</p>



<p>I want to assure you that we have always gone above and beyond to make certain <strong>our clients are in full compliance with the TCPA, CTIA and other regulatory bodies</strong> that may govern application-to-person communications, and marketing via text messaging. And we always will.</p>



<p>To ensure a lack of bias in our assessment, we are currently completing a full audit of the Voyage compliance program, conducted independently by third-party legal counsel. We’ll publish the results here when we have them.</p>



<p>SMS compliance and deliverability protocols are constantly evolving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year, we have already witnessed the impact of the deprecation of shared short codes and the introduction of 10DLC on an SMS marketing platform’s ability to adapt and evolve quickly. <strong>We have dedicated resources consistently canvassing the regulatory landscape,</strong> and we always embed relevant updates into our service and product accordingly.</p>



<p>Voyage&#8217;s goal is to protect brands to the fullest extent possible when it comes to their SMS marketing and commerce program.</p>



<p>As a reminder, <strong>Voyage clients have access to the following compliance-related features:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Robust reporting capabilities, to ensure they know when and by which method every subscriber has opted-in to an SMS program.</li><li>Manual unsubscribe of any customer, as requested in the Settings panel.</li><li>Double opt-in activation for certain list building methods that require it, including keyed-in entry and keyword list building campaigns</li></ul>



<p>Additionally, we’ve received a few client requests to implement a &#8220;fuzzy opt-out&#8221; feature. This is <strong>not </strong>a hard requirement governed by the TCPA, CTIA, etc. However, as we always take product feedback seriously, <strong>we are working on shipping a best-in-class Voyage version of fuzzy opt-out</strong> before the end of the month – that will be more accurate than those of other SMS platforms.</p>



<p>The challenge with any sort of fuzzy logic is to not inadvertently unsubscribe someone who does not have that intention. We have direct evidence there are issues with this feature in other SMS platforms, including (ironically) the competitor making claims against us.</p>



<p>See below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1206" srcset="/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example.png 550w, /content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example-300x282.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><figcaption>An example of an inadvertent opt-out due to imprecise fuzzy logic. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Voyage Fuzzy Opt-out will be smarter about ensuring that subscribers who are opted-in do not inadvertently unsubscribe.</p>



<p>For example, if a customer texts: &#8220;I would like to stop my order. Can you help me?,&#8221; this would not inaccurately unsubscribe the user.</p>



<p>Instead, it would generate a prompt to open a CS ticket and/or show up in our Live Conversions panel for response. In fact, carriers have explicitly stated that automatic opt-out within a use case such as this is “invalid.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-1024x558.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1207" srcset="/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-1024x558.png 1024w, /content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-300x164.png 300w, /content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-768x419.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Voyage keyword and opt-out trigger logic tree.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, we have also anecdotally heard that this same aforementioned <strong>competitor is claiming that multi-message drips are non-compliant</strong>. </p>



<p>This is also false.</p>



<p>The reality is that Voyage employs a more robust technology than our competitors, that enables multi-message drip automations that drive higher conversions and unlocks additional revenue from high-intent customers.</p>



<p>The only written guidance that exists in this regard references best practices, provided at present by T-Mobile only. The T-Mobile code of conduct suggests that one alert should be sent per abandoned cart within 48 hours.</p>



<p>To clarify, <strong>this is <em>not</em> a requirement by official governing bodies such as the TCPA and CTIA</strong>. We have confirmed this with two of the largest SMS message aggregators, who have decades of relationship experience with carriers.</p>



<p>In other words, at time of writing, <strong>sending a multi-message cart abandonment series will <em>not</em> result in a fine</strong> and is unlikely to result in any sort of broad message filtering.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, we are adding the ability to segment by a recipient&#8217;s carrier in our segmentation builder. If desired, brands can add a T-Mobile filter to their cart abandonment drip automation.</p>



<p>And, as always, brands can modify (and/or request that our service team modify) their cart abandonment automation series on the UI, to be single or multi-message.</p>



<p>We are confident that Voyage offers the most robust SMS marketing and message commerce solution in the market. Our platform will only continue to get more powerful over time, as we continue to partner with leading eCommerce brands.</p>



<p>As a reminder of <strong>what brands get with Voyage</strong>, that other platforms may not offer:</p>



<ul><li>More robust segmentation, including event and attribute metadata drill-down</li><li>Custom events on the UI, for use in drip automations and segmentation</li><li>Multi-message drip automations</li><li>Flexible, advanced reporting with Voyage Report Builder</li><li>Dynamic Click to Buy, for browse abandon, cart abandon and checkout abandon drip automations</li><li>Personalized variables from event data and subscriber attributes in list building, drip automations and marketing campaigns</li><li>Fully custom, hand-crafted, on-brand modals that drive quicker list growth than templated and semi-custom modals</li><li>Personalized conversational commerce at scale through Live Conversions, including as a Voyage managed service (in beta, available for wide release in early Q3)</li><li>And more&#8230;with more to come.</li></ul>



<p>These features offer brands the flexibility and precision to drive maximal revenue, hyper-personalize messages at scale, and grow + engage their communities.</p>



<p>As we continue to expand our team, including by growing our product and engineering functions, the Voyage platform will continue to evolve and advance.</p>



<p><strong>We are committed to offering clients the most cutting edge solutions that SMS marketing and message commerce has to offer.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rev Reddy</strong><br />CEO of Voyage SMS</p>

Why? Because shared short codes have historically provided the highest level of throughput (100+ msgs/second) at the best deliverability rate (near 100%) at the lowest marginal economic cost for brands ($0).\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCarriers are beginning to grandfather out shared short codes with a requirement for SMS platforms to submit migration plans by March 1, 2021. The reasoning behind this is twofold:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e1. Carriers want to more readily be able to manage communication sent for Application-to-Person (A2P) traffic to monitor for terms of use violations (e.g. messaging without explicit opt-in protocols)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e2. There has been an influx of non-compliant SMS providers in the market, putting brands at risk of a significant per-message fine. A great example of a non-compliant message is sending an abandoned checkout message to a consumer who has not explicitly opted in previously (which we help protect you from!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny text messages sent from a business that are informational or promotional in nature are automatically rendered “A2P” by the carriers. So yes, the above applies to you if you are a brand.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, with shared short codes going away, how will brands be able to send text messages to their consumers who love receiving these timely and personalized alerts?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Number Formats\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith the phase out of shared short codes, there are several number infrastructure solutions for brands to be aware of. Voyage has noted which numbers are and are not sanctioned by the carriers for A2P traffic. Again, as a business sending marketing messages, brands are automatically defined as A2P.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDedicated Short Code (SANCTIONED for A2P)\u003c/strong\u003e – Brands can utilize a dedicated short code, which costs $500 per month at an absolute minimum (most aggregators add a $500 short-code monitoring fee on top of this to ensure ongoing compliance). This looks, acts, and behaves in the exact same manner as a shared short code, except no other brand will co-occupy said short code.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eToll-Free and High Throughput Toll-Free (SANCTIONED for A2P)\u003c/strong\u003e: The next best alternative to a dedicated short code. Toll-free numbers (1-800) maintain similarly high deliverability rates. Throughput can be extended to match short codes, but at a price that is pro-ratably set based on throughput increases. The only real difference between high-throughput toll-free numbers and short codes is the number format. Toll-free numbers will be supported for free by Voyage.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10 Digit Long Code, or 10DLC (SANCTIONED for A2P, but not operational)\u003c/strong\u003e: You have likely or will likely hear a lot about “10DLC”. However, this has yet to be rolled out by all of the carriers. Only Verizon has rolled it out currently. AT\u0026amp;T is rolling it out in March 2021, with TMO/Sprint shortly behind. However, there are major issues that the carriers need to work through before 10DLC can become a good solution for brands. For instance, carriers necessitate that all campaigns must be pre-approved by them prior to sending within the 10DLC infrastructure. As you can imagine, this is not ideal for instantaneous automated messages, such as abandoned checkout drips! For these reasons, Voyage strongly recommends against utilizing 10DLC at this time. It is Voyage’s hope that within the next 12 months, these 10DLC issues will be worked out, and that this number infrastructure can effectively replace shared short codes as the primary economical format for message delivery.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10 Digit Local (NOT SANCTIONED for A2P)\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e10 digit local looks and feels like 10DLC (and looks like a normal number!). However, the carriers have not sanctioned this for A2P traffic, reserving it for only P2P traffic (Person-to-Person). As such, the carriers have been filtering messages over 10 digit local, resulting in poor deliverability. This filtering will significantly increase starting on March 1, 2021. Because of this, for the time being, Voyage will not be supporting 10 digit local. This decision ensures that the messages you pay for actually reach your consumers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBonus Material\u003c/em\u003e: make sure your SMS marketing provider is not spreading your A2P text messages over hundreds of 10 digit local numbers.

You can leverage your social media presence as well, offering discount codes to people for sharing their phone numbers and email addresses.

However, it’s important to take a step back and take a big-picture look at the whole campaign first. Think through the user journey and your audience segments \u0026#8211; craft campaigns to make leads buy, to get feedback from present customers, and upsell to long-term users. Your goal shouldn’t be to communicate for the sake of building the brand. SMS marketing is purpose-driven, and each message you send should have a clear purpose and a clear and actionable expectation from the recipient. Build out your automated campaigns, and continually measure their effectiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeep it direct and simple\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSMS as a medium is more personal than email. People reach for their smartphones as soon as they wake up, and the mobile phone is the default channel for one-on-one communication for most individuals. The limited character count in SMS also means that brevity is essential in getting your message across. In other words, keep it short and simple, with a clear CTA that spurs the recipients into clicking or reacting the way you want them to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!--kg-card-end: html--\u003e","comment_id":"446","feature_image":"/content/images/wordpress/2019/04/computer-smartphone-hand-screen-person-blur-914018-pxhere.com-1-300x200-1.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2019-04-11T14:39:14.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-12T18:49:17.000+00:00","published_at":"2019-04-11T14:39:14.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"authors":[{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512\u0026d=mm\u0026r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"}],"tags":[],"primary_author":{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512\u0026d=mm\u0026r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"},"primary_tag":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/effective-sms-marketing-for-ecommerce/","excerpt":"Email marketing has long been the bread-and-butter of direct digital marketing,\nbut it’s quickly losing ground.
