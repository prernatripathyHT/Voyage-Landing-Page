Many of these are about cultivating LTV, which is more important than ever as SMS continues to grow as a channel.</p><ol><li><strong>Welcome Series:</strong> Include an image reflecting your brand's voice and tone to build a deeper relationship with your customers. Particularly with list building, you should have significant \"margin\" to include an MMS. Images can directly increase initial conversion rates.</li><li><strong>Brand Building &amp; Awareness Campaigns:</strong> Brands should engage with their subscriber list ideally once per week, to keep their SMS subscriber lists warm. Not doing so can risk your lists feeling exploited only for sales and conversions. GIFs/MMS and emojis (where it fits with your brand voice) are often best used to build brand equity with prospective and current customers in an authentic way.</li><li><strong>Product Launches &amp; Waitlists:</strong> Showing the product with a visual image increases conversion rates. If you are promoting a broader product line, create a GIF (Voyage GIF Builder Coming Soon) to highlight multiple SKUs.</li><li><strong>All Conversion Drips:</strong> For Abandoned Browse, Cart, Checkout, and Back-in-Stock notifications, inclusion of a dynamic product image materially increases conversion rates for high intent customers. You can use Voyage's Dynamic Product Image option in your drips to automate this.</li></ol><p>As BFCM approaches, hopefully these tips can help get your creative engine running on how to best leverage MMS.</p><p>We look forward to seeing the results of your MMS sends in the near future, and we believe you'll be happy to see them, too.</p><h3 id=\"new-to-voyage-sms\">New to Voyage SMS?</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.voyagesms.com/get-started\">Schedule a demo</a> to learn more.</p>","comment_id":"6173011155eac40048a10646","feature_image":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/2021/10/MMS_blog_social.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-10-22T18:21:05.000+00:00","updated_at":"2021-10-22T18:33:01.000+00:00","published_at":"2021-10-22T18:33:01.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"At Voyage, we take your account performance very seriously — ROAS is a key metric in our approach to client success.

Brands","slug":"temp-slug-38","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<h3><strong>TL;DR: Most Can Still Utilize SMS with Proper Age Gating</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sex, Hate, Alcohol, Firearms, and Tobacco. And text messaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For so-called S.H.A.F.T. companies, keeping in compliance with SMS legislation and carrier rules can seem daunting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Referred to by many businesses as a new “wild west,” in 2021 there’s been a lot of talk (and some confusion) about what is and isn’t permitted for SMS eCommerce, if you operate a brand that might fall under one of these categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Voyage SMS, it’s our mission to help a diversity of clients best serve their customers, so let’s dig into the overall situation with SMS and S.H.A.F.T. brands, and clear up the confusion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, you can be sure to not only remain in compliance but also pursue your business goals through SMS – worry-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let’s move past one common misconception.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Rules Haven’t Changed – But Enforcement Has Shifted</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent chatter about SMS compliance updates are in actuality not about new legislative changes applying to S.H.A.F.T companies. Such rules have been in effect for a while, and have remained largely the same for some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What <em>has</em> changed is carrier enforcement. Carriers are simply paying more attention to whether S.H.A.F.T. brands are following federal rules under the FCC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This increased scrutiny has for related reasons coincided with the grandfathering out of shared short codes. With more brands texting, carriers want to more easily gather detailed information on who is and who is not complying with regulation. You can’t do that when brands are sharing short codes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the facts. The rumors circulating suggest a more dramatic – and incorrect – interpretation: that S.H.A.F.T. companies are being restricted from SMS marketing altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>That’s not the case – with one exception*</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Solution: Proper Age Gating</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage SMS was built to flexibly serve all marketers’ unique needs. Just as no consumer is the same, no brand is the same. This remains a primary driver of our product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, our custom-designed lead capture forms ensure immediate compliance for all S.H.A.F.T. brands. Consumers must provide a valid age to opt-in to our text messaging platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, look at how we’re executing proper age gating for Winc:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM-1024x536.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1228\" srcset=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM-1024x536.png 1024w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM-300x157.png 300w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM-768x402.png 768w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-11.16.32-AM.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For any brand leaders that want to be doubly sure, you don’t have to just take our word for it.

And we always will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure a lack of bias in our assessment, we are currently completing a full audit of the Voyage compliance program, conducted independently by third-party legal counsel. We’ll publish the results here when we have them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SMS compliance and deliverability protocols are constantly evolving.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, we have already witnessed the impact of the deprecation of shared short codes and the introduction of 10DLC on an SMS marketing platform’s ability to adapt and evolve quickly. <strong>We have dedicated resources consistently canvassing the regulatory landscape,</strong> and we always embed relevant updates into our service and product accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage&#8217;s goal is to protect brands to the fullest extent possible when it comes to their SMS marketing and commerce program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder, <strong>Voyage clients have access to the following compliance-related features:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Robust reporting capabilities, to ensure they know when and by which method every subscriber has opted-in to an SMS program.</li><li>Manual unsubscribe of any customer, as requested in the Settings panel.</li><li>Double opt-in activation for certain list building methods that require it, including keyed-in entry and keyword list building campaigns</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, we’ve received a few client requests to implement a &#8220;fuzzy opt-out&#8221; feature. This is <strong>not </strong>a hard requirement governed by the TCPA, CTIA, etc. However, as we always take product feedback seriously, <strong>we are working on shipping a best-in-class Voyage version of fuzzy opt-out</strong> before the end of the month – that will be more accurate than those of other SMS platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge with any sort of fuzzy logic is to not inadvertently unsubscribe someone who does not have that intention. We have direct evidence there are issues with this feature in other SMS platforms, including (ironically) the competitor making claims against us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1206\" srcset=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example.png 550w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/Attntv-Unsub-example-300x282.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /><figcaption>An example of an inadvertent opt-out due to imprecise fuzzy logic. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage Fuzzy Opt-out will be smarter about ensuring that subscribers who are opted-in do not inadvertently unsubscribe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a customer texts: &#8220;I would like to stop my order. Can you help me?,&#8221; this would not inaccurately unsubscribe the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, it would generate a prompt to open a CS ticket and/or show up in our Live Conversions panel for response. In fact, carriers have explicitly stated that automatic opt-out within a use case such as this is “invalid.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-1024x558.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1207\" srcset=\"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-1024x558.png 1024w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-300x164.png 300w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/06/image-2-768x419.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption><em>Voyage keyword and opt-out trigger logic tree.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we have also anecdotally heard that this same aforementioned <strong>competitor is claiming that multi-message drips are non-compliant</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also false.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality is that Voyage employs a more robust technology than our competitors, that enables multi-message drip automations that drive higher conversions and unlocks additional revenue from high-intent customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only written guidance that exists in this regard references best practices, provided at present by T-Mobile only. The T-Mobile code of conduct suggests that one alert should be sent per abandoned cart within 48 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To clarify, <strong>this is <em>not</em> a requirement by official governing bodies such as the TCPA and CTIA</strong>. We have confirmed this with two of the largest SMS message aggregators, who have decades of relationship experience with carriers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, at time of writing, <strong>sending a multi-message cart abandonment series will <em>not</em> result in a fine</strong> and is unlikely to result in any sort of broad message filtering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, we are adding the ability to segment by a recipient&#8217;s carrier in our segmentation builder. If desired, brands can add a T-Mobile filter to their cart abandonment drip automation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as always, brands can modify (and/or request that our service team modify) their cart abandonment automation series on the UI, to be single or multi-message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are confident that Voyage offers the most robust SMS marketing and message commerce solution in the market. Our platform will only continue to get more powerful over time, as we continue to partner with leading eCommerce brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder of <strong>what brands get with Voyage</strong>, that other platforms may not offer:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>More robust segmentation, including event and attribute metadata drill-down</li><li>Custom events on the UI, for use in drip automations and segmentation</li><li>Multi-message drip automations</li><li>Flexible, advanced reporting with Voyage Report Builder</li><li>Dynamic Click to Buy, for browse abandon, cart abandon and checkout abandon drip automations</li><li>Personalized variables from event data and subscriber attributes in list building, drip automations and marketing campaigns</li><li>Fully custom, hand-crafted, on-brand modals that drive quicker list growth than templated and semi-custom modals</li><li>Personalized conversational commerce at scale through Live Conversions, including as a Voyage managed service (in beta, available for wide release in early Q3)</li><li>And more&#8230;with more to come.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These features offer brands the flexibility and precision to drive maximal revenue, hyper-personalize messages at scale, and grow + engage their communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we continue to expand our team, including by growing our product and engineering functions, the Voyage platform will continue to evolve and advance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We are committed to offering clients the most cutting edge solutions that SMS marketing and message commerce has to offer.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rev Reddy</strong><br />CEO of Voyage SMS</p>\n<!--kg-card-end:

And <strong><em>message commerce</em></strong> is the right tool for exploring it – especially for brands with an eye on the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Emergence of Message Commerce: Filling a Gap</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first purchase on mobile occurred in 2008. Although the channel has obviously proved a potent driver of growth, brands face a few key challenges (even today) in pursuing scalable eCommerce success outside of desktop environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, to the lament of many marketers, most web sites are still not built with a mobile-first mindset. At the same time, and likely related to this, the explosive growth in browsing on mobile hasn&#8217;t kept pace with purchasing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until now, this has made mobile a lucrative channel for generating leads, but not necessarily for increasing conversions in like proportion. As a shopping experience, mobile can seem inferior to a consumer looking for more versatility, or speed, or just an easier purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But advancements in SMS eCommerce are closing this gap on mobile – fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SMS Evolution: From One-Way Blasts to Full Connectivity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Message commerce is in many ways already here, but the true potential of the channel has only begun to reveal itself to leading-edge marketers and engagement specialists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Voyage SMS, we help leading eCommerce brands meet their customers where they are, not only on their phones but in their texts messages, where open rates remain extraordinarily higher than email (as high as 98% to 15%).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see our clients succeeding with conversions everyday. As we&#8217;ve worked in tandem with them on their sales and engagement campaigns, it&#8217;s become clear that together we&#8217;re witnessing the evolution of SMS eCommerce into message commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the very near future, this will manifest as brands servicing their customers more fully on their terms, offering a flexible, individualized, full-cycle experience on SMS – that benefits everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Text-to-Buy sales flows</em></strong> will speed up checkouts and reduce abandoned carts.</li><li><strong><em>Digital wallets</em></strong>, attached to the much more reliable identifier of a phone number, will reduce complexity with conversions, delivering a more seamless experience for customers and fostering greater goodwill and loyalty for brands.</li><li><strong><em>Customers can text brands</em></strong> their questions, get them answered, and receive the sort of service a desktop interface can&#8217;t offer so easily and that web apps aren&#8217;t often focused on providing.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, message commerce is about catching sales pipelines up to consumer experience and expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Message Commerce Is About Quality and Efficiency</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a sample funnel:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A user sees an ad on Instagram</li><li>Swiping up on the ad opens an SMS message</li><li>User sends the message, your brand replies</li><li>The user replies &#8220;Buy,&#8221; and/or you answer their questions</li><li>Payment/Shipping details are captured and confirmed via app integration, or later, as part of their digital wallet</li><li>Receipt sent to customer, with a planned delay to allow for shipping and payment adjustments</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This keeps transactions simple, highly portable, and versatile among platforms and integrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, brands move from struggling to secure and identify leads on mobile for later desktop conversion –&nbsp;to guiding consumers from interest to purchase with less effort, right within their messages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Future Use Cases: Data-Driven Growth</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Already, we&#8217;re seeing early versions of this sort of buyer engagement pay dividends for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Utilizing SMS to close the gap between mobile browsing and desktop conversion ensures that brands&#8217; highest-engagement marketing channel is more closely aligned with their sales channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>For single SKU or low assortment brands</strong> that sell through direct channels, offer basic subscriptions, or want to upsell or maintain reorders, message commerce can lead to incredible growth.</li><li><strong>Retailers and restaurants</strong> will soon be able to offer contactless checkout via SMS. Customers can pay their bill by texting a number on their receipt.</li><li><strong>Non-profits and political organizations</strong> can collect donations more quickly, and at greater scale.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In all these cases, brands and organizations leveraging message commerce will continue to build data-driven customer lists and segments that can be immediately applied to further optimize and grow sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is only the beginning for message commerce</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Take Your Brand Into The Future with Message Commerce</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology required to secure this future is already here, and marketers and sellers looking to stay ahead would do well to keep pace with this exciting new frontier in eCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With our best-in-class SMS eCommerce platform and our dedicated experts blazing the trail, Voyage SMS will continue to lead the way towards message commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Interested in partnering with

SMS marketing is no different.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may or may not have heard, but the SMS marketing world is undergoing a change in how texts are delivered. Our guess is if you have heard, you are likely only hearing an incomplete story.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage has spent countless hours scrubbing through CTIA and TCPA protocols and promulgations and talking to CPaaS experts, carrier conduits and aggregators, and TCPA lawyers. Compliance and deliverability are the absolute highest priority for Voyage, and we want to ensure brands – whether Voyage clients or not – are in the best position to (1) stay fully compliant; (2) ensure deliverability of their text messages; and (3) maximize ROAS.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Actually Happening?</strong><br /></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gone are the days of the almighty shared short code.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All SMS platforms loved utilizing shared short codes. Why? Because shared short codes have historically provided the highest level of throughput (100+ msgs/second) at the best deliverability rate (near 100%) at the lowest marginal economic cost for brands ($0).&nbsp;<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carriers are beginning to grandfather out shared short codes with a requirement for SMS platforms to submit migration plans by March 1, 2021. The reasoning behind this is twofold:<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Carriers want to more readily be able to manage communication sent for Application-to-Person (A2P) traffic to monitor for terms of use violations (e.g. messaging without explicit opt-in protocols)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. There has been an influx of non-compliant SMS providers in the market, putting brands at risk of a significant per-message fine. A great example of a non-compliant message is sending an abandoned checkout message to a consumer who has not explicitly opted in previously (which we help protect you from!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any text messages sent from a business that are informational or promotional in nature are automatically rendered “A2P” by the carriers. So yes, the above applies to you if you are a brand.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, with shared short codes going away, how will brands be able to send text messages to their consumers who love receiving these timely and personalized alerts?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>New Number Formats</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the phase out of shared short codes, there are several number infrastructure solutions for brands to be aware of. Voyage has noted which numbers are and are not sanctioned by the carriers for A2P traffic. Again, as a business sending marketing messages, brands are automatically defined as A2P.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Dedicated Short Code (SANCTIONED for A2P)</strong> – Brands can utilize a dedicated short code, which costs $500 per month at an absolute minimum (most aggregators add a $500 short-code monitoring fee on top of this to ensure ongoing compliance). This looks, acts, and behaves in the exact same manner as a shared short code, except no other brand will co-occupy said short code.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Toll-Free and High Throughput Toll-Free (SANCTIONED for A2P)</strong>: The next best alternative to a dedicated short code. Toll-free numbers (1-800) maintain similarly high deliverability rates. Throughput can be extended to match short codes, but at a price that is pro-ratably set based on throughput increases. The only real difference between high-throughput toll-free numbers and short codes is the number format. Toll-free numbers will be supported for free by Voyage.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>10 Digit Long Code, or 10DLC (SANCTIONED for A2P, but not operational)</strong>: You have likely or will likely hear a lot about “10DLC”. However, this has yet to be rolled out by all of the carriers. Only Verizon has rolled it out currently. AT&amp;T is rolling it out in March 2021, with TMO/Sprint shortly behind. However, there are major issues that the carriers need to work through before 10DLC can become a good solution for brands. For instance, carriers necessitate that all campaigns must be pre-approved by them prior to sending within the 10DLC infrastructure. As you can imagine, this is not ideal for instantaneous automated messages, such as abandoned checkout drips! For these reasons, Voyage strongly recommends against utilizing 10DLC at this time. It is Voyage’s hope that within the next 12 months, these 10DLC issues will be worked out, and that this number infrastructure can effectively replace shared short codes as the primary economical format for message delivery.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>10 Digit Local (NOT SANCTIONED for A2P)</strong>:<strong> </strong>10 digit local looks and feels like 10DLC (and looks like a normal number!). However, the carriers have not sanctioned this for A2P traffic, reserving it for only P2P traffic (Person-to-Person). As such, the carriers have been filtering messages over 10 digit local, resulting in poor deliverability. This filtering will significantly increase starting on March 1, 2021. Because of this, for the time being, Voyage will not be supporting 10 digit local. This decision ensures that the messages you pay for actually reach your consumers.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bonus Material</em>: make sure your SMS marketing provider is not spreading your A2P text messages over hundreds of 10 digit local numbers. This process – colloquially referred to as “snow shoeing” – is strictly prohibited by the carriers. If caught, the carriers reserve the right to suspend brands’ A2P text messaging capabilities.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Summary:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to utilize SMS marketing – and we absolutely think you should! – ensure your provider is up to speed, compliant, and communicative with you about what is happening.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voyage takes compliance and deliverability quite seriously.

This makes SMS more effective for promotional campaigns and special discounts, as brands can ensure that their customers never miss a good deal or offer.</p><p>Brands can leverage this engagement to make sure that consumers get timely notifications for confirming their orders, acknowledging payment, and tracking their deliveries. SMS is also useful in helping brands <a href=\"http://blog.voyagetext.com/guides-to-sms-marketing/text-messaging-abandoned-cart/\">recover their abandoned carts more effectively</a>.</p><h2 id=\"the-solution\"><strong>The Solution</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/\">Voyage</a> helped an ecommerce client build a text marketing campaign as a part of a 4-day sale, generating $360k in revenue through SMS.

Like email, you can automate your text marketing campaigns using messaging platforms so you can spend more time designing better campaigns and doing what you do best.</p><p>With a text marketing solution, you can also leverage data from past campaigns from your CRM, app, or website to design new campaigns or optimize ongoing ones for better outcomes. You can then use SMS to consistently engage customers with targeted and personalized messages with offers, discounts, updates on new products, etc. Using the analytics capabilities of their existing marketing management systems, you can extract insight on customer engagement to further optimize various elements of an SMS campaign, such as the timing, length, and frequency of the messages.</p><p>You can also create more detailed protocols for how you communicate with your customers. By categorizing the levels of engagement with customers based on factors such as the frequency or recency of their interaction with the brand, transaction value, and customer lifetime value, you can ensure that you’re targeting your customers appropriately.</p><h2 id=\"sms-apis\"><strong>SMS APIs</strong></h2><p>An SMS API is a software integration interface that you can use to build a personalized SMS channel for a business. The API can be seamlessly integrated with your existing digital channels to create a centralized control center for all marketing, allowing you to:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/product\">Send hundreds of SMS messages</a> instantaneously in various formats</li><li>Receive text messages</li><li>Conduct surveys among customers</li><li>Access real-time status reports on campaigns and texts</li></ul><p>Businesses that sell their products or services online can integrate SMS APIs with their websites or sales platforms to use existing customer data to personalize messages.

Determining how to help your target audience find your store and bringing them on board can be even more difficult - that's where ecommerce marketing comes in.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-ecommerce-marketing\"><strong>What is ecommerce marketing?</strong></h2><p>Ecommerce marketing is the process of attracting, acquiring, and retaining customers for your online business. Anything that brings more people to your online store, helps convert them into customers, and subsequently gives them a reason to keep buying from you is ecommerce marketing.</p><p>Ecommerce marketing is a better and more <a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/product\">cost-effective way of promoting your business</a> than conventional marketing. Ecommerce marketing builds digital touchpoints between your business and your customers using a combination of channels such as email, SMS, social media, contextual ads, and so on. Over time, you’ll know what works best for your business. With some solid first steps, you can set your store up for success and boost revenue while you figure out your long-term strategy.</p><h2 id=\"ecommerce-marketing-ideas-to-increase-online-sales\"><strong>Ecommerce marketing ideas to increase online sales</strong></h2><h3 id=\"get-social-with-instagram-facebook-snapchat-and-twitter\"><strong>Get social with Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter</strong></h3><p>Instagram has grown to over 1 billion monthly active users, with 500m people using it every day. Facebook is still the biggest platform by far, with 1.2b daily users. If you are looking for an audience, you have to go where they are. Take a week to build an account for your business on each of these websites. Get into a comfortable rhythm for sharing content, and keep generating original posts to share. With high quality pictures showcasing your products, positive customer reviews and feedback, and content videos, you can use social media to get noticed and drive traffic back to your platform.</p><h3 id=\"build-your-audience-for-direct-to-consumer-marketing\"><strong>Build your audience for direct to consumer marketing</strong></h3><p>Websites and social media are digital platforms which customers can use to get to your products, but direct marketing turns that on its head. Direct marketing refers to the use of channels such as SMS and Email to reach out to potential customers and giving them a good reason to buy your products. This is one of the best ways to generate revenue and generally offers the best ROI in digital marketing.</p><p>The advantage of direct marketing lies in personalization. Direct messaging is designed for a specific user, not the public at large. 80% of consumers are more likely to buy when their experience with a brand is personalized. But you can’t send these messages without gathering an audience by building a distribution list first.</p><p>Make sure your website and your social media pages have a way for customers to sign up for a newsletter or other DTC platforms. You may choose to incentivize customers to share their emails or phone numbers by offering them a small discount. Once they confirm their credentials and opt-in, they receive a discount and become an eager customer waiting to hear from you.</p><p>Here are some basic rules for building your direct marketing campaign -</p><ul><li><strong>Use multiple channels: </strong>Using SMS and email together increases sales by 38%.

The best way to <a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/\">win that customer back</a> is to send them timely reminders. An immediate SMS letting them know that their cart is waiting for them is a good start. If they still don’t take the bait, send an email after some time to remind them once again. A follow-up SMS or email after a few days can also capture some conversions. Cart abandonment messages are clicked on far more often than normal promotional emails and show a CTR of 21% and a conversion rate of 10.5%.</p><h3 id=\"start-building-out-your-content\"><strong>Start building out your content</strong></h3><p>Building a blog helps your website rank higher in search engines, attract more traffic, engage customers better, and tell stories which create more loyal customers. Most importantly, it humanizes and enriches a connection which the consumer shouldn’t see as purely transactional.</p><p>The great thing about blogs is that they don’t just stay there on your website - you can promote the content on social media and start valuable conversations with your audience. Plus, building brand loyalty and community ensures that your customers remember your product and business. Marketers who prioritize blogs are 13x more likely to achieve a positive ROI on their marketing efforts than those who don’t.</p><p>Ecommerce marketing requires a bit of time and intentionality; in the end, the ROI and customer retention that it generates makes it a worthwhile venture.</p>","comment_id":"611de2ae500330003e87aeda","feature_image":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/igor-miske-207639-unsplash-768x444-1.jpeg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-08-19T04:48:46.000+00:00","updated_at":"2021-08-27T20:53:22.000+00:00","published_at":"2019-04-24T17:43:00.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"authors":[{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"}],"tags":[{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b1","name":"eCommerce Digital Marketing 101","slug":"ecommerce-digital-marketing-101","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/ecommerce-digital-marketing-101/"},{"id":"6130c0dd4b6af0003b03536e","name":"Blog","slug":"blog","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/blog/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b1","name":"eCommerce Digital Marketing 101","slug":"ecommerce-digital-marketing-101","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/ecommerce-digital-marketing-101/"},"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/ecommerce-marketing-strategies-for-customer-acquisition/","excerpt":"Ecommerce marketing strategies for customer acquisition\n\nBuilding out your brand is hard, and setting up your ecommerce business and an\nonline store is only half the battle.

Lead generation is one of the most important elements of your inbound marketing strategy and plays a major role in converting visitors into leads and eventually into paying customers. If your business is small and relatively new, quality is always more important than quantity when it comes to <a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/product\">lead generation</a>.</p><p>But <em>how</em> do you generate more qualified leads? The simplest answer: through high-quality content. To be more specific, you need content that adds value to the customer and helps them in their buyer journey. You need the customer to be able to find you online easily, especially if your business is in the ecommerce domain. Here, inbound marketing contributes greatly to a business’s lead generation.</p><p>Some of the most prominent and effective methods of generating leads through inbound marketing include website SEO optimization, blogs, social media posts and engagements, landing pages, videos, etc. Outbound marketing tools like paid search, banner ads, social media ads, email marketing, SMS marketing etc. create a demand for your products or services, prompting them to engage with your brand online.</p><p>After choosing the right marketing channels to use, you must define your audience. For this, you need to create a buyer persona for your potential customers, typically based on parameters such as their age and gender, their income, and from where they were sourced as a lead. Then, identify which channels your audience engages with the most. This will help you create a more accurate buyer journey to send your message on the right channels at the right time.</p><h2 id=\"why-text-marketing-is-an-effective-lead-generation-tool\"><strong>Why text marketing is an effective lead generation tool</strong></h2><p>SMS marketing can be set up in almost no time - unlike email marketing, there is no design or development involved. Not only is it easier to create a message, but texts are also more likely to generate a response from recipients than emails. At least 90% of texts are opened, compared to just 20% of emails. That’s nearly five times the engagement of email and considerably more than any other channel.</p><p>The simplest and most reliable way of gaining consent from your leads is to use an SMS marketing platform. With the help of the platform, you can ask leads and prospects to provide consent by using a simple input to opt in to your text marketing list.</p><p>If your SMS marketing platform integrates with your CRM, you can track opt-ins and use system filters to make sure you never send messages to anyone who doesn’t want them.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-sms-marketing-for-lead-nurturing\"><strong>How to use SMS marketing for lead nurturing</strong></h2><h3 id=\"personalize\"><strong>Personalize</strong></h3><p>This is an important one. When we say personalization, we mean gathering information about leads and their interests, then marketing to them by showing them things that you know they will be interested in. Not everyone wants the same things, so sending blanket emails and displaying the same offers to everyone on your ecommerce site will leave you short of your goals. With a good <a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/\">SMS marketing solution</a>, you can gather information about leads’ likes, dislikes, interests and past buying behaviors (and more), and use this information to personalize your outreach.</p><p>If they have browsed for new shoes on your site, send them emails about a sale you’re having on shoes. If they’ve purchased t-shirts in the past, configure your marketing automation system to display pop-ups that offer them discounts on t-shirts. Marketing automation software makes this easy by allowing you to assign tags to leads based on their behavior and then segment them based on those tags.</p><h3 id=\"get-to-know-your-leads\"><strong>Get to know your leads</strong></h3><p>Marketing works with Sales to establish key criteria for lead segmentation and scoring. Hopefully, you have already created a comprehensive list of buyer personas and a detailed buyer journey for each. The next step is to plan how you will capture this information through landing pages and forms, using a progressive profiling approach so that conversion rates are kept high. Identify relevant pages and events that, if visited or triggered, also allow you to update lead profiles during the buyer journey. Access LinkedIn, Data.com, Hoovers and other business data sites you can use to cross-reference leads and further develop their profiles. Some of these sources can be directly integrated through HubSpot and Salesforce apps and APIs.</p><h3 id=\"lead-scoring\"><strong>Lead Scoring</strong></h3><p>Set up lead scoring criteria and point system to update lead lifecycle stages, move leads to the CRM at the right time, and trigger notifications using marketing automation workflows. Leads accumulate positive scores for behavior and demographics.</p><p><strong>Create a buyer persona</strong></p><p><strong><em>Based on:</em></strong></p><p><strong>Engagement</strong>: number of visits, unique page views, repeat visits, form conversions, email opens and clicks, blog comments, social media mentions, inbound links.</p><p><strong>Buyer stage</strong>: clicks and conversions on specific content indicating a lead lifecycle change, such as mid-funnel and bottom-funnel offers.</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>: recency of engagement, volume and timing of events indicating an imminent intent to buy. Also, apply negative scoring for form answers or behaviors that designate a lead as a poor fit, for example: competitor company, low budget or non-company email address.</p>","comment_id":"611de25d500330003e87aed4","feature_image":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/carlos-arthur-m-r-1147377-unsplash-1-768x512-1.jpeg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-08-19T04:47:25.000+00:00","updated_at":"2021-08-27T20:35:15.000+00:00","published_at":"2019-04-23T18:23:00.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"authors":[{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"}],"tags":[{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b1","name":"eCommerce Digital Marketing 101","slug":"ecommerce-digital-marketing-101","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/ecommerce-digital-marketing-101/"},{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b0","name":"SMS Marketing Best Practices","slug":"sms-marketing-best-practices","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/sms-marketing-best-practices/"},{"id":"6130c0dd4b6af0003b03536e","name":"Blog","slug":"blog","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/blog/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b1","name":"eCommerce Digital Marketing 101","slug":"ecommerce-digital-marketing-101","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/ecommerce-digital-marketing-101/"},"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/effective-lead-generation-and-nurturing-with-sms-marketing/","excerpt":"If you run an ecommerce business, you don’t need us to tell you how crucial\ngenerating leads is for achieving sales.

The investment is the cost of running the campaign, and the return is the overall positive impact it had on your sales, adjusted to reflect how expensive the campaign was. Thus, digital marketing ROI works out to (Increase in Sales - Cost of Campaign)/Cost of Campaign.</p><p>This doesn’t translate well when looking across companies and channels. The value generated from getting a customer to buy a book or buy a house is very different, and would skew ROI measurements substantially. Using this method to arrive at ROI for digital marketing channels doesn’t work.</p><p>The solution is to remove price from the equation and focus on the number of users persuaded to make a purchase. That way, we can arrive at the cost of acquiring customers (CAC), which is a very powerful marketing metric.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-customer-acquisition-cost-cac-so-important\"><strong>Why is Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) so important?</strong></h2><p>CAC is one of the most important ecommerce and digital marketing metrics. Having a high CAC means that your marketing is ineffective and is costing too much. It also helps companies choose between digital marketing channels, and is a great way to assess your marketing ROI.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-calculate-customer-acquisition-cost-cac\"><strong>How to calculate Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)?</strong></h2><p>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is the cost of acquiring a single customer. This means that you calculate it by adding up all your marketing spending and dividing it by the number of customers acquired by your marketing.</p><p>For example, if you want to measure the effectiveness of your Google Ads spending, your CAC would be - Total Spend/Number of Customers Acquired. A Q1 2018 study shows that the CAC (also known as the Cost Per Acquisition/CPA) for Google Ads is $45.27 for Ecommerce and for Facebook ads is $18.68.</p><p>We know how much <a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/pricing\">SMS marketing costs at Voyage</a> (check out our attractive pricing plans). Using the Small Business plan and the conversion rate benchmark above, for $18.68 you can acquire 359 customers.

Using the wrong strategy or tools for engagement can cost you money, time, and credibility.</p><p>SMS is extremely effective in grabbing the attention of customers. 64% of consumers prefer that businesses communicate with them through texts, which is why it’s critical to leverage SMS to the maximum to get your brand and message out there.</p><p>(Source: \"<a href=\"https://www.clockworksms.com/blog/integrate-text-messaging-with-your-crm/\">Integrate text messaging with your CRM</a>\", Clockwork, 01/29/2018)</p><p>Although businesses can easily send personalized and targeted messages to customers and prospects with SMS, creating and delivering those messages at scale can be tricky. That’s where <a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/\">SMS marketing automation</a> can help by taking the guesswork and extra effort out of the equation. The result? More data-driven, tailored, and engaging messages for your audience.</p><p>Before launching a new marketing campaign, it is important to map out your objectives clearly since they will drive the effectiveness of the tools and methods you use. Begin by integrating your most fundamental marketing channels like SMS and email into your CRM and marketing automation system. Eventually, as your business grows, you can include other channels like social media into the automated ecosystem to scale up your marketing and engagement efforts.</p><h2 id=\"advantages-of-sms-marketing\"><strong>Advantages of SMS Marketing</strong></h2><h3 id=\"cost-effective\"><strong>Cost-effective</strong></h3><p>SMS marketing can deliver substantial returns on investments for businesses of all sizes without making a huge dent on the budget. For startups and SMBs in particular, text marketing can deliver higher and faster sales conversion rates than email marketing campaigns. At just a few cents per text message, you can run highly targeted campaigns and truly leverage mobile as a channel to boost engagement and sales.</p><h3 id=\"faster-deployment\"><strong>Faster deployment</strong></h3><p>Using an <a href=\"https://voyagesms.com/product\">SMS platform</a>, businesses can send bulk SMS messages almost instantly that have higher open rates than messages sent from other marketing channels.

However, text messages can be a highly personalized way of communicating with customers or leads, especially by addressing them by name.</p><h3 id=\"easy-to-create-and-deliver-messages\"><strong>Easy to create and deliver messages</strong></h3><p>Since SMS messages have a 160-character limit, composing one is faster and simpler, requiring lesser resources and time. With marketing automation, the process becomes even easier. Since customer data and analytics are already fed into the software, the automated platform works on its own to create relevant and personalized messages for customers or leads.

Once you have a ready audience, all you need to do is decide how to pitch your offer effectively.</p><p>The most effective promotional campaigns are those which add value to consumers, and meet customers where they are. Existing customers shouldn’t see products they bought being offered at a discount later on, but should get loyalty discounts on accessories or other products that are similar to their initial purchase. For perishable items or products with a particular life cycle, a reminder to restock at the right time works better.

With consumers increasingly using smartphones to make purchases, SMS marketing helps you connect with your audience where they are, and when they are most receptive to you.</p><p>(Source: <a href=\"https://dma.org.uk/research/dma-insight-consumer-email-tracker-2017\">DMA Insight: Consumer email tracker 2017</a>)</p><p>(Source: <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/the-mobile-series-mobile-commerce-infographic\">eMarketer, Exploring the Mobile Shopping Habits of US Consumers</a>, 2018)</p><h2 id=\"how-can-you-use-sms-marketing-instead-of-email-marketing\"><strong>How can you use SMS Marketing instead of Email marketing?</strong></h2><p>Ecommerce startups and small businesses can use SMS for:</p><ul><li><strong>Promotions</strong> - Drive sales and enhance engagement with discounts, codes, and coupons</li><li><strong>Customer Service</strong> - Communicate order confirmations and delivery details instantaneously</li><li><strong>Abandonment Solutions</strong> - Reduce abandoned shopping carts</li><li><strong>Drip Marketing</strong> - Build automated campaigns that continually engage across the consumer lifecycle</li><li><strong>Remarketing and Upselling</strong> - Continue to sell other products and services to your audience</li></ul><p>Voyage helps businesses build a distribution list through modals (for both web and Instagram), APIs at checkout, and keywords &amp; short codes. Generally, using a discount or offer to sweeten the deal helps get the opt-ins you need.</p><p>As with email marketing, your SMS marketing campaign will be more effective if it is personalized. Voyage can help you collect and analyze data on clicks, purchases, and engagement with each message, so your messaging can evolve to produce the results you want. If you can keep track of your audience and categorize them effectively, you can build extremely effective campaigns with great ROI. Voyage helps businesses do this with automated customer segmentation.</p><h2 id=\"promotions\"><strong>Promotions</strong></h2><p>SMS marketing is a great way to drive up sales by sending customers exclusive discounts and coupon codes. Promotions allow you to push past the initial hesitation on the part of the customer and close the sale. During the initial stages, this will be the best way to build your distribution list, drive better brand loyalty, and grow your business’s customer base and audience. Use caution to avoid becoming a one trick pony - get a little creative. Customers respond better to discounts that come as a prize for answering a question or playing a game than repetitive offers of savings.</p><h2 id=\"customer-service\"><strong>Customer Service</strong></h2><p>SMS is already heavily leveraged in ecommerce to communicate useful consumer information such as order confirmations and delivery details. These automated alerts are an ecommerce requirement. By fully utilizing the power of SMS, it becomes a great way to provide responsive customer service and gather customer feedback. Regular check-ins with existing customers as well as short NPS surveys can let you know how your audience is doing and improve your processes to enhance customer experience and satisfaction.</p><h2 id=\"abandonment-solution\"><strong>Abandonment Solution</strong></h2><p>When engaged customers don’t end up completing the sale, a variety of factors could be at play. Abandoned cart solutions via SMS are more effective than email because they are instantaneous. You can remind distracted customers that the products or services they wanted to buy are waiting for them. If there’s no response, a follow-up with an offer can sometimes help you salvage the sale.</p><h2 id=\"drip-marketing\"><strong>Drip Marketing</strong></h2><p>Consistency and persistence are critical to building an <a href=\"https://blog.voyagesms.com/guides-to-sms-marketing/sms-marketing-increase-ecommerce-sales/\">effective marketing campaign</a>. Drip campaigns are pre-written sets of messages that are sent based on timelines, triggered by user actions, or both. They can make your startup punch well above its weight in terms of being responsive to customer needs. Putting in the effort and thought to organize a comprehensive drip campaign across multiple touch points can help you build a strong and engaged user community around your startup.</p><h2 id=\"remarketing-and-upselling\"><strong>Remarketing and Upselling</strong></h2><p>Startups can greatly enhance their sales without dipping too far into their marketing budgets by continuing to leverage existing customers instead of attracting new ones. Acquiring a new customer is far more time consuming, expensive, and difficult. Combining promotions, drip marketing, and upselling can get your existing customers to buy more expensive products or services from you, and this gives fantastic ROI.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Don’t get us wrong - email marketing is and will continue to remain effective as ever. But the most effective marketing campaign will not leverage just one, but multiple channels. When it comes to engagement now and in the future, SMS marketing should be the channel of choice for ecommerce startups in 2019.</p>","comment_id":"611de470500330003e87aef4","feature_image":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/william-iven-8515-unsplash-1-768x510-1.jpeg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-08-19T04:56:16.000+00:00","updated_at":"2021-08-27T20:23:03.000+00:00","published_at":"2019-04-11T18:25:00.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"authors":[{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"}],"tags":[{"id":"612920904b6af0003b0352de","name":"SMS Marketing Industry News","slug":"sms-marketing-industry-news","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/sms-marketing-industry-news/"},{"id":"6130c0dd4b6af0003b03536e","name":"Blog","slug":"blog","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/blog/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"612920904b6af0003b0352de","name":"SMS Marketing Industry News","slug":"sms-marketing-industry-news","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/sms-marketing-industry-news/"},"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/how-sms-marketing-will-change-your-channels-forever/","excerpt":"While digital marketing has changed dramatically, the need for businesses to\nconnect with customers at the right time and using the right channel has\nremained constant.

Choosing the one that’s right for you involves deciding which features and pricing best suit your specific needs. Here are some considerations when making your choice:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Does it require coding?</strong> Choose a platform with an easy-to-use editor. Your platform should be built for marketers, not for developers.</li><li><strong>Is it automated? </strong>The most useful platforms will allow for automated customer segmentation and building a calendar for a forward-looking plan and campaign.</li><li><strong>Can you optimize? </strong>The best platforms will allow you to track the effectiveness of different messages, and collect customer-level data and click information.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Build your distribution list</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have chosen a service provider, the next step is to build your audience. Most businesses ask users to share their email addresses to receive offers or promotions. This usually comes at the end of them making a purchase, or as an opt-in field on the website. However, this doesn’t always have a lot of traction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other ways to get opt-ins are the same as with email &#8211; nothing makes a customer willing to share their email address or phone number as much as a discount does. You can leverage your social media presence as well, offering discount codes to people for sharing their phone numbers and email addresses. You can also offer free content, such as a webinar or ebook, to build your distribution list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Ensure compliance before you text</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t just bad marketing to SMS someone without their permission &#8211; it is against the law to send promotional digital communication to someone without them expressly opting in. Therefore, you should make 100% sure that you have a digital record of customers who choose to opt-in, and that you additionally provide an unsubscribe option with every marketing SMS that you send.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Craft the right message</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You should be set to send out your first marketing SMS at this stage. However, it’s important to take a step back and take a big-picture look at the whole campaign first. Think through the user journey and your audience segments &#8211; craft campaigns to make leads buy, to get feedback from present customers, and upsell to long-term users. Your goal shouldn’t be to communicate for the sake of building the brand. SMS marketing is purpose-driven, and each message you send should have a clear purpose and a clear and actionable expectation from the recipient. Build out your automated campaigns, and continually measure their effectiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Keep it direct and simple</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SMS as a medium is more personal than email. People reach for their smartphones as soon as they wake up, and the mobile phone is the default channel for one-on-one communication for most individuals. The limited character count in SMS also means that brevity is essential in getting your message across. In other words, keep it short and simple, with a clear CTA that spurs the recipients into clicking or reacting the way you want them to.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->","comment_id":"446","feature_image":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2019/04/computer-smartphone-hand-screen-person-blur-914018-pxhere.com-1-300x200-1.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2019-04-11T14:39:14.000+00:00","updated_at":"2021-08-27T16:28:51.000+00:00","published_at":"2019-04-11T14:39:14.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"authors":[{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"}],"tags":[{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b0","name":"SMS Marketing Best Practices","slug":"sms-marketing-best-practices","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/sms-marketing-best-practices/"},{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b1","name":"eCommerce Digital Marketing 101","slug":"ecommerce-digital-marketing-101","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/ecommerce-digital-marketing-101/"},{"id":"6130c0dd4b6af0003b03536e","name":"Blog","slug":"blog","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/blog/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"60ee75b8879460003b392268","name":"Voyage Team","slug":"corey","profile_image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a74ad2a5da38dc6b014b229a91e21052?s=512&d=mm&r=g","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/author/corey/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"612912c34b6af0003b0352b0","name":"SMS Marketing Best Practices","slug":"sms-marketing-best-practices","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/tag/sms-marketing-best-practices/"},"url":"https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/effective-sms-marketing-for-ecommerce/","excerpt":"Email marketing has long been the bread-and-butter of direct digital marketing,\nbut it’s quickly losing ground.
