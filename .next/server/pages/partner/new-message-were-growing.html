<h4>Announcing A New Wave of SMS eCommerce Leaders at Voyage</h4>



<p>With our clients continuing to grow and succeed through our best-in-class SMS eCommerce solutions, Voyage SMS has brought on several new team members to keep pace. Please join us in welcoming our newest leaders, already hard at work scaling the highest-converting eComm technology on the market today towards your sales and community-building goals.</p>



<h3>Alice Pai</h3>



<h4><em>Head of Client Success</em></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/alice@2x.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1129" width="170" height="205" srcset="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/alice@2x.png 340w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/alice@2x-249x300.png 249w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" /></figure></div>



<p>A champion of the client-first mindset, Alice joins Voyage SMS with nearly a decade of experience in wireless, working with industry mainstays such as Motorola and HTC. On the SMS side, she most recently oversaw national sales and partnerships at healthcare/SMS engagement firm mPulse Mobile. Alice additionally served on the sales leadership team for Chariot/Ford, helping to develop go-to-market enterprise strategy and execute regional marketing initiatives. An avid outdoorswoman, she enjoys cooking (when inside) and adventuring with her two pups.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Max Wardaki</h2>



<h4><em>Head of Operations</em></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/max@2x.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1131" width="170" height="205" srcset="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/max@2x.png 340w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/max@2x-249x300.png 249w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" /></figure></div>



<p>After stops at L.E.K. Consulting and AlphaSights, following his graduation from Princeton, Max now brings his additional experience with strategy, analytics, and financial modeling to Voyage SMS. When he isn’t optimizing business structures, Max enjoys reading, traveling, and sports. On this last point, to keep things fresh, he performs most activities left-handed – except when he’s at the plate or hitting the tee.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Ralles Liu</h2>



<h4>Lead Client Support Engineer</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/ralles@2x.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1132" width="170" height="205" srcset="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/ralles@2x.png 340w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/ralles@2x-249x300.png 249w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" /></figure></div>



<p>San Francisco-based engineer Ralles Liu graduated with a degree in finance from NYU, but pivoted to engineering after a year in investment banking. With experience across the stack,&nbsp;especially in JavaScript, React, and Python, he’s hit the ground running at Voyage SMS. Ralles loves poker nights and drives up to Lake Tahoe whenever he can for some skiing.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>James Gill</h2>



<h4><em>Head of Client Ops</em></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/jamesg@2x-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1134" width="170" height="205" srcset="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/jamesg@2x-1.png 340w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/jamesg@2x-1-249x300.png 249w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" /></figure></div>



<p>Helping clients succeed in their implementations and integrations is what drives James Gill, who joins Voyage SMS with key experience in customer support, triage, operations and programming. A dual-major grad of Cal Poly Pomona (Finance and Marketing), James lives at the intersection of commerce and engineering. An avid reader and traveler, he’s worked on multiple continents. While downtime on the beach is great, James prefers to also suit up in some scuba gear during his travels, to explore the seas as well.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Kenan Muhovic</h2>



<h4><em>Product Manager</em></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/kenan@2x.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1135" width="170" height="205" srcset="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/kenan@2x.png 340w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/kenan@2x-249x300.png 249w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" /></figure></div>



<p>A proud “entrepreneurial doer,” Kenan brings his experiences starting his own company in Luxembourg, as well as serving as an Innovation Consultant and Growth Product Manager at places like The Board of Innovation and JOB TODAY, to his new role at Voyage SMS. By combining his skills in analytical thinking and personal communications with additional passions for holistic well-being, philosophy and spirituality, Kenan offers Voyage SMS and its clients a cross-disciplinary perspective.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Johnny Crain</h2>



<h4><em>Business Development Rep</em></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/johnny@2x.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1138" width="170" height="205" srcset="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/johnny@2x.png 340w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/johnny@2x-249x300.png 249w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" /></figure></div>



<p>The only thing that new Voyage SMS Director of Growth Johnny Crain knows better than growth marketing is running – and even that point is debatable, since he’s successfully combined the two pursuits through his past experiences in eCommerce. As the founder of TWB Running, Johnny created new revenue streams for products like virtual running camps and local fitness clinics, leading to +25% income growth, +200% email list growth, and nearly 180% organic traffic growth YOY. He loves anything outdoors, and was one of only six athletes in the U.S. to finish the 2016 Olympic Trials in both the marathon and the 10K.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Zach Sherrod</h2>



<h4><em>Account Executive</em></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/zach@2x.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1137" width="170" height="205" srcset="https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/zach@2x.png 340w, https://sms-marketing-resources.ghost.io/content/images/wordpress/2021/05/zach@2x-249x300.png 249w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" /></figure></div>



<p>Marketing runs through everything Zach Sherrod has done, leading up to his joining Voyage SMS as Digital Growth Executive. Beginning from the foundation of his degree in Marketing and Entrepreneurship, he has gained specialized expertise in outbound sales, ABM marketing and analytics. With stops along the way in executive recruiting consultation for MarTech CMOs across the country, Zach’s journey eventually led him to SaaS and SMS marketing, where he most recently worked for SF-based Sense. An avid outdoorsman, he loves to run, hike, or snowboard during his downtime. He also digs music, a passion that may or may not have something to do with the fact that Johann Sebastian Bach is a distant relative.</p>

Why? Because shared short codes have historically provided the highest level of throughput (100+ msgs/second) at the best deliverability rate (near 100%) at the lowest marginal economic cost for brands ($0).\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCarriers are beginning to grandfather out shared short codes with a requirement for SMS platforms to submit migration plans by March 1, 2021. The reasoning behind this is twofold:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e1. Carriers want to more readily be able to manage communication sent for Application-to-Person (A2P) traffic to monitor for terms of use violations (e.g. messaging without explicit opt-in protocols)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e2. There has been an influx of non-compliant SMS providers in the market, putting brands at risk of a significant per-message fine. A great example of a non-compliant message is sending an abandoned checkout message to a consumer who has not explicitly opted in previously (which we help protect you from!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny text messages sent from a business that are informational or promotional in nature are automatically rendered “A2P” by the carriers. So yes, the above applies to you if you are a brand.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, with shared short codes going away, how will brands be able to send text messages to their consumers who love receiving these timely and personalized alerts?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Number Formats\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith the phase out of shared short codes, there are several number infrastructure solutions for brands to be aware of. Voyage has noted which numbers are and are not sanctioned by the carriers for A2P traffic. Again, as a business sending marketing messages, brands are automatically defined as A2P.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDedicated Short Code (SANCTIONED for A2P)\u003c/strong\u003e – Brands can utilize a dedicated short code, which costs $500 per month at an absolute minimum (most aggregators add a $500 short-code monitoring fee on top of this to ensure ongoing compliance). This looks, acts, and behaves in the exact same manner as a shared short code, except no other brand will co-occupy said short code.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eToll-Free and High Throughput Toll-Free (SANCTIONED for A2P)\u003c/strong\u003e: The next best alternative to a dedicated short code. Toll-free numbers (1-800) maintain similarly high deliverability rates. Throughput can be extended to match short codes, but at a price that is pro-ratably set based on throughput increases. The only real difference between high-throughput toll-free numbers and short codes is the number format. Toll-free numbers will be supported for free by Voyage.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10 Digit Long Code, or 10DLC (SANCTIONED for A2P, but not operational)\u003c/strong\u003e: You have likely or will likely hear a lot about “10DLC”. However, this has yet to be rolled out by all of the carriers. Only Verizon has rolled it out currently. AT\u0026amp;T is rolling it out in March 2021, with TMO/Sprint shortly behind. However, there are major issues that the carriers need to work through before 10DLC can become a good solution for brands. For instance, carriers necessitate that all campaigns must be pre-approved by them prior to sending within the 10DLC infrastructure. As you can imagine, this is not ideal for instantaneous automated messages, such as abandoned checkout drips! For these reasons, Voyage strongly recommends against utilizing 10DLC at this time. It is Voyage’s hope that within the next 12 months, these 10DLC issues will be worked out, and that this number infrastructure can effectively replace shared short codes as the primary economical format for message delivery.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10 Digit Local (NOT SANCTIONED for A2P)\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e10 digit local looks and feels like 10DLC (and looks like a normal number!). However, the carriers have not sanctioned this for A2P traffic, reserving it for only P2P traffic (Person-to-Person). As such, the carriers have been filtering messages over 10 digit local, resulting in poor deliverability. This filtering will significantly increase starting on March 1, 2021. Because of this, for the time being, Voyage will not be supporting 10 digit local.
